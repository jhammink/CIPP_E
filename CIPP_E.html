<p class="into">This is a collection of information I
collected for taking the <a href="https://iapp.org/certify/cippe/">IAPP
CIPP/E Privacy certification</a>
based on GDPR. At the time of writing this (beginning of 2017) the
textbooks were not yet updated to reflect the changes due to GDPR.
Fortunately, almost everything can be found online. <br>
The structure of the document is the <a
 href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/certification/CIPP_E_BoK_1.1.0.pdf">CIPP/E
Body of Knowledge version 1.1.0</a> as outline by IAPP. <span
 class="emphasis">Bold text</span> is my own emphasis. <span
 class="comment"> Italic text</span>
are my own personal words, interpretations and opinions. I'm not a
lawyer so your mileage may vary. For me, writing and studying it was
enough to let me pass the CIPP/E exam and most of the knowledge
required to pass can be found in this document. I would recommend to
also read the additional Web based privacy resources and GDPR resources
as mentioned on the IAPP web site, as some of the questions require
knowledge of how to apply the law in case based situations. Also, some
of the guidelines and reports from those resources contain information
that may be subject of the certification.&nbsp;</p>

No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy,
family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and

such interference or attacks. (source: <a

1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life,
his home and his correspondence. <br>
2. <a name="ECHR_Article_8.2"></a>There
shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of
this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is
necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national
security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for
the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or
morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

Early laws and regulations</h3>
<p>A
right to protection of an individual’s private sphere against intrusion
from others, especially from the state, was laid down in an
international legal instrument for the first time in <span
 class="emphasis">Article 12 of the United Nations (UN)
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) of 1948 </span>on
respect for private and family life.1 The UDHR influenced the
development of other human rights instruments in Europe. (source: <a
 href="http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2014/handbook-european-data-protection-law">handbook
data protection law 2nd ed</a>) <br>
<br>
The Council of Europe was formed in the aftermath of the Second World
War to bring together the states of Europe to promote the rule of law,
democracy, human rights and social development. For this purpose, it
adopted the <span class="emphasis">European Convention on
Human Rights (ECHR) in 1950, which entered into force in 1953</span>.
States have an international obligation to comply with the ECHR. All
CoE member states have now incorporated or given effect to the ECHR in
their national law, which requires them to act in accordance with the
provisions of the Convention. To ensure that the Contracting Parties
observe their obligations under the ECHR, the European Court of Human
Rights (ECtHR), was set up in Strasbourg, France, in 1959. The ECtHR
ensures that states observe their obligations under the Convention by
considering complaints from individuals, groups of individuals, NGOs or
legal persons alleging violations of the Convention.(source: <a

<br>
<br>
<span class="emphasis">1981: Convention 108</span> <br>
With of the emergence of information technology in the 1960s, a growing
need developed for more detailed rules to safeguard individuals by
protecting their (personal) data. By the mid-1970s, the Committee of
Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted various resolutions on the
protection of personal data, referring to Article 8 of the ECHR.7 In
1981, <span class="emphasis">a Convention for the
protection of individuals with regard to the automatic processing of
personal data (Convention 108)</span> was opened for
signature.(source: <a
 href="http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2014/handbook-european-data-protection-law">handbook

108 was, and still remains, the only legally binding international</span>
<span class="emphasis">instrument in the data protection
field.</span> <br>
<br>
All EU Member States have ratified Convention 108. In 1999, Convention
108 was amended to enable the EU to become a Party.9 In 2001, an
Additional Protocol to Convention 108 was adopted, introducing

<ul>
  <li>Convention
108 applies to all data processing carried out by both the private and
public sector, such as data processing by the judiciary and law
enforcement authorities. </li>
  <li>It protects the individual
against abuses, which may accompany the collection and processing of
personal data, and seeks, at the same time, to regulate the transborder
flow of personal data. As regards the collection and processing of
personal data, the principles laid down in the convention concern, in
particular, fair and lawful collection and automatic processing of
data, stored for specified legitimate purposes and not for use for ends
incompatible with these purposes nor kept for longer than is necessary.
  </li>
  <li>They also concern the quality of the data, in
particular that they must be adequate, relevant and not excessive
(proportionality) as well as accurate. </li>
  <li>In addition
to providing guarantees on the collection and processing of personal
data, it outlaws, in the absence of proper legal safeguards, the
processing of ‘sensitive’ data, such as on a person’s race, politics,
health, religion, sexual life or criminal record. </li>
  <li>The
convention also enshrines the individual’s right to know that
information is stored on him or her and, if necessary, to have it
corrected. Restrictions on the rights laid down in the convention are
possible only when overriding interests, such as state security or
defence, are at stake.</li>

Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC)</span></p>
<p><span class="emphasis">2000: Charter of
Fundamental Rights
of the European Union</span> <br>
The original treaties of the European Communities did not contain any
reference to human rights or their protection. As cases came before the
then European Court of Justice (ECJ) alleging human rights violations
in areas within the scope of EU law, however, it developed a new
approach. To grant protection to individuals, it brought fundamental
rights into the so-called general principles of European law. According
to the CJEU, these general principles reflect the content of human
rights protection found in national constitutions and human rights
treaties, in particular the ECHR. The CJEU stated that it would ensure
the compliance of EU law with these principles. In recognising that its
policies could have an impact on human rights and in an effort to make
citizens feel ‘closer’ to the EU, the EU in 2000 proclaimed the Charter
of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Charter). This Charter
incorporates the whole range of civil, political, economic and social
rights of European citizens, by synthesising the constitutional
traditions and international obligations common to the Member States.
The rights described in the Charter are divided into six sections:
dignity, freedoms, equality, solidarity, citizens’ rights and justice. <br>
Although originally only a political document, the <span
 class="emphasis">Charter became legally binding as EU
primary law</span> (see Article 6 (1) of the TEU) with the coming
into force of the <span class="emphasis">Lisbon Treaty on
1 December 2009</span>. <br>
The Charter not only guarantees the respect for private and family life
(Article 7), but also establishes the right to data protection (Article
8), explicitly raising the level of this protection to that of a
fundamental right in EU law. EU institutions as well as Member States
must observe and guarantee this right, which also applies to Member
States when implementing Union law (Article 51 of the Charter).
Formulated several years after the Data Protection Directive, Article 8
of the Charter must be understood as embodying pre-existing EU data
protection law. The Charter, therefore, not only explicitly mentions a
right to data protection in Article 8 (1), but also refers to key data
protection principles in Article 8 (2). Finally, Article 8 (3) of the
Charter ensures that an independent authority will control the
implementation of these principles.(source: <a

The need for a harmonised European approach</h3>
<p>Every
day within the EU, businesses, public authorities and individuals
transfer vast amounts of personal data across borders. Conflicting data
protection rules in different countries would disrupt international
exchanges. Individuals might also be unwilling to transfer personal
data abroad if they were uncertain about the level of protection in
other countries. <br>
Therefore, common EU rules have been established to
ensure that your personal data enjoys a high standard of protection
everywhere in the EU. You have the right to complain and obtain redress
if your data is misused anywhere within the EU. (source: <a

The organisation is distinct from the 28-nation European
Union (EU), although it is sometimes confused with it, partly because
the EU has adopted the original European Flag which was created by the
Council of Europe in 1955,[5] as well as the European Anthem.[6] No

The Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with
Regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data of 1981 (The CoE
Convention)</h3>
<p>CoE Convention 108 is the first international
legally binding instrument dealing explicitly with data protection.
Convention 108 was, and still remains, the only legally binding
international instrument in the data protection field. <br>
<br>
Convention 108 applies to all data
processing carried out by both the private and public sector, such as
data processing by the judiciary and law enforcement authorities. It
protects the individual against abuses, which may accompany the
collection and processing of personal data, and seeks, at the same
time, to regulate the transborder flow of personal data. As regards the
collection and processing of personal data, the principles laid down in
the convention concern, in particular, fair and lawful collection and
automatic processing of data, stored for specified legitimate purposes
and not for use for ends incompatible with these purposes nor kept for
longer than is necessary. They also concern the quality of the data, in
particular that they must be adequate, relevant and not excessive
(proportionality) as well as accurate. In addition to providing
guarantees on the collection and processing of personal data, it
outlaws, in the absence of proper legal safeguards, the processing of
‘sensitive’ data, such as on a person’s race, politics, health,
religion, sexual life or criminal record. The convention also enshrines
the individual’s right to know that information is stored on him or her
and, if necessary, to have it corrected. Restrictions on the rights
laid down in the convention are possible only when overriding
interests, such as state security or defence, are at stake. Although
the convention provides for free flow of personal data between State
Parties to the convention, it also imposes some restrictions on those
flows to states where legal regulation does not provide equivalent
protection. <br>
<br>
Treaty No.181: <span>The text will increase the protection of
personal data and privacy by improving the original Convention of 1981 (</span><a
 href="https://www.coe.int/web/conventions-staging/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/108">ETS
No. 108</a><span>)
in two areas. Firstly, it provides for the setting up of national
supervisory authorities responsible for ensuring compliance with laws
or regulations adopted in pursuance of the convention, concerning
personal data protection and transborder data flows. The second
improvement concerns transborder data flows to third countries. Data
may only be transferred if the recipient State or international
organisation is able to afford an adequate level of
protection.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId439213"></a>2.
The EU Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC)</h3>
<p>The
principal EU legal instrument on data protection is Directive 95/46/EC
of the European Parliament and the Council of 24 October 1995 on the
protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal
data and on the free movement of such data (Data Protection
Directive).11 It was adopted in 1995, at a time when several Member
States had already adopted national data protection laws. Free movement
of goods, capital, services and people within the internal market
required the free flow of data, which could not be realised unless the
Member States could rely on a uniform high level of data protection. <br>
<br>
As the aim of adopting the Data Protection
Directive was harmonisation12 of data protection law at the national
level, the directive affords a degree of specificity comparable to that
of the (then) existing national data protection laws. For the CJEU,
“Directive 95/46 is intended […] to ensure that the level of protection
of the rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing
of personal data is equivalent in all Member States. […] The
approximation of the national laws applicable in this area must not
result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the
contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the EU.
Accordingly, […] the harmonisation of those national laws is not
limited to minimal harmonisation but amounts to harmonisation which is
generally complete.”13 Consequently, the EU Member States have only
limited freedom to manoeuvre when implementing the directive. <br>
<br>
The Data Protection Directive is designed
to give substance to the principles of the right to privacy already
contained in Convention 108, and to expand them. The fact that all 15
EU Member States in 1995 were also Contracting Parties to Convention
108 rules out the adoption of contradictory rules in these two legal
instruments. The Data Protection Directive, however, draws on the
possibility, provided for in Article 11 of Convention 108, of adding on
instruments of protection. In particular, the introduction of
independent supervision as an instrument for improving compliance with
data protection rules proved to be an important contribution to the
effective functioning of European data protection law. (Consequently,
this feature was taken over into CoE law in 2001 by the Additional
Protocol to Convention 108.) <br>
<br>
The territorial application of the Data
Protection Directive extends beyond the 28 EU Member States, including
also the non-EU Member States that are part of the European Economic
Area (EEA)14 – namely Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. <br>
<br>
The CJEU in Luxembourg has jurisdiction to
determine whether a Member State has fulfilled its obligations under
the Data Protection Directive and to give preliminary rulings
concerning the validity and interpretation of the directive, in order
to ensure its effective and uniform application in the Member States.
An important exemption from the applicability of the Data Protection
Directive is the so-called household exemption, namely the processing
of personal data by private individuals for merely personal or
household purposes.15 Such processing is generally seen as part of the
freedoms of the private individual. <br>
<br>
Corresponding to EU primary law in force
at the time of the adoption of the Data Protection Directive, the
material scope of the directive is limited to matters of the internal
market. Outside its scope of application are, most importantly, matters
of police and criminal justice cooperation. (source: <a

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId656520"></a>Unsolicited

purposes. The Directive establishes the<a

where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the
recipient. A natural or legal person who initially collects address
data in the context of the sale of a product or service, has the right
to use it for commercial purposes provided the customers have a prior
opportunity to reject such communication where it was initially
collected and subsequently. Member States have the obligation to ensure
that unsolicited communication will be prohibited, except in
circumstances given in Article 13. <br>

<p> The Directive provision applicable to<a

 title="HTTP cookie">cookies</a>is
Article 5(3). Recital 25 of the Preamble recognizes the importance and
usefulness of cookies for the functioning of modern Internet and
directly relates Article 5(3) to them but Recital 24 also warns of the
danger that such instruments may present to privacy. The change in the
law does not affect all types of cookies; those that are deemed to be
"strictly necessary for the delivery of a service requested by the
user", such as for example, cookies that track the content's of a
user's shopping cart on an<a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shopping"
 title="Online shopping">online shopping</a>service,
are exempted. <br>
The article is technology neutral, not naming any specific
technological means which may be used to store data, but applies to any
information that a website causes to be stored in a user's browser.
This reflects the EU legislator’s desire to leave the regime of the
directive open to future technological developments. <br>
The addressees of the obligation are Member States, who
must ensure that the use of electronic communications networks to store
information in a visitor's browser is only allowed if the user is
provided with “clear and comprehensive information”, in accordance with
the<a

 title="Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data">Data
Protection Directive</a>, about the purposes of the storage of,
or access to, that information; and has given his or her consent. <br>
The regime so set-up can be described as<a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt_in_e-mail"
 class="mw-redirect" title="Opt in e-mail">opt-in</a>,
effectively meaning that the consumer must give his or her consent
before cookies or any other form of data is stored in their browser.
The UK Regulations allow for consent to be signified by future browser
settings, which have yet to be introduced but which must be capable of
presenting enough information so that a user can give their informed
consent and indicating to a target website that consent has been
obtained. Initial consent can be carried over into repeated content
requests to a website. The Directive does not give any guidelines as to
what may constitute an opt-out, but requires that cookies, other than
those "strictly necessary for the delivery of a service requested by
the user" are not to be placed without user consent. <br>

<p>Who an information society service is provided that consists
of the
transmission in a communication network of information provided by a
recipient of the service, or the provision of access to a communication
network, Member States shall ensure that the service provider is not
liable for the information transmitted, on condition that the provider:
(a) does not initiate the transmission; (b) does not select the
receiver of the transmission; and (c) does not select or modify the
information contained in the transmission. The acts of transmission and
of provision of access include the automatic, intermediate and
transient storage of the information transmitted in so far as this
takes place for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission in
the communication network, and provided that the information is not
stored for any period longer than is reasonably necessary for the
transmission. <br>
</p>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId39850"></a>"Caching"</h4>
<p> Where an
information society service is provided that consists of the
transmission in a communication network of information provided by a
recipient of the service, Member States shall ensure that the service
provider is not liable for the automatic, intermediate and temporary
storage of that information, performed for the sole purpose of making
more efficient the information's onward transmission to other
recipients of the service upon their request, on condition that: (a)
the provider does not modify the information; (b) the provider complies
with conditions on access to the information; (c) the provider complies
with rules regarding the updating of the information, specified in a
manner widely recognized and used by industry; (d) the provider does
not interfere with the lawful use of technology, widely recognized and
used by industry, to obtain data on the use of the information; and (e)
the provider acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the
information it has stored upon obtaining actual knowledge of the fact
that the information at the initial source of the transmission has been
removed from the network, or access to it has been disabled, or that a
court or an administrative authority has ordered such removal or
disablement. <br>

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId436797"></a>Hosting</h4>
<p> Where an information
society service is provided that consists of the storage of information
provided by a recipient of the service, Member States shall ensure that
the service provider is not liable for the information stored at the
request of a recipient of the service, on condition that: (a) the
provider does not have actual knowledge of illegal activity or
information and, as regards claims for damages, is not aware of facts
or circumstances from which the illegal activity or information is
apparent; or (b) the provider, upon obtaining such knowledge or
awareness, acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the

European data retention regimes</h3>
<p>The
Data Retention Directive 2006/24/EC: According to the directive, member
states will have to store citizens' telecommunications data for a
minimum of 6 months and at most 24 months. On 8 April 2014, the Court
of Justice of the European Union declared the Directive invalid
(source: <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Retention_Directive">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Retention_Directive</a>)
<br>
<br>
In 2014, the CJEU invalidated the Data Retention Directive, holding
that it provided insufficient safeguards against interferences with the
rights to privacy and data protection. This decision triggered
considerable activity at both judicial and legislative levels in 2015. <br>
<br>
In the absence of a valid Data Retention
Directive, Member States may still provide for a data retention scheme.
However, such schemes must also comply with the rules regarding the
rights to privacy and personal data protection set out in Article 15 of
the ePrivacy Directive, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the
CJEU ruling. (source: <a

attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person;<br>
Anonymous data: </span><span>information
which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person
or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data
subject is not or no longer identifiable.</span> </p>

Controller</h3>
<p><span>‘controller’
means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other
body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and
means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means
of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the

Data Protection Principles</h2>
<p> <span class="comment">All principles apply:</span>
</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId287566"></a>1.
Fairness and lawfulness</h3>
<p><span>processed
lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data
subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’);</span> <br>
<span class="comment">*fairly *: open term for normal,
decent behavior</span> </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId720292"></a>2.
Purpose limitation</h3>
<p><span>collected
for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further
processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further
processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or
historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in
accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible
with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);</span> <br>
<span class="comment">* legitimate *: There has to be a
reason justifying the limitation to the right to privacy. </span>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId491607"></a>3.
Proportionality</h3>
<p><span>adequate,
relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes
for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’);<br>
<span class="comment">* limited *: both in terms of scope
and time (data retention)</span> <br class="comment">
<span class="comment">*adequate *: Collecting too little
information may lead to incorrect or incomplete </span>information
on a data subject</span> </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId792420"></a>4.
Accuracy</h3>
<p><span>accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; <span
 class="emphasis">every reasonable step</span>
must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having
regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or
rectified without delay (‘accuracy’);</span> </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId592901"></a>5.
Storage limitation</h3>
<p><span>kept
in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer
than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are
processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as
the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in
the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to
implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures
required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and
freedoms of the data subject (‘storage limitation’)</span> <br>
13 2 (a) the controller shall, at the time when personal data are
obtained, provide the data subject with the following further
information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing:: the
period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not
possible, the criteria used to determine that period; <br>
<span class="comment">So the controller must determine
explicit retention periods or criteria</span> <br>
</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId869465"></a>6.
Integrity and confidentiality</h3>
<p><span>processed
in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data,
including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and
against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate
technical or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’)</span>
</p>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId584313"></a>D.
Legitimate Processing Criteria</h2>
<p> <span class="comment">Any one of these criteria
is sufficient</span> <br>
Regarding processing of data for other purposes: <br>
Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the
personal data have been collected is not based on the data subject's
consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary
and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the
objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order
to ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with
the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, take
into account, inter alia: <br>
(a) any link between the purposes for which the personal
data have been collected and the purposes of the intended further
processing; <br>
(b) the context in which the personal data have been
collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data
subjects and the controller; <br>
(c) the nature of the personal data, in particular
whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to
Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and
offences are processed, pursuant to Article 10; <br>
(d) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for
data subjects; <br>
(e) the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include
encryption or pseudonymisation. </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId351010"></a>1.
Consent</h3>
<p><span>4: ‘consent’ of the data subject means any <span
 class="emphasis">freely given, specific, informed and
unambiguous</span> indication of the data subject's wishes by
which he or she, by a statement or by a <span class="emphasis">clear
affirmative action</span>, signifies agreement to the processing
of personal data relating to him or her</span> <br>
Article 7:: <br>
</p>
<p>1.Where
processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to
demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or
her personal data.</p>
<p>2.If the data subject's consent is given
in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other
matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which
is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible
and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of
such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation
shall not be binding.</p>
<p>3.The data subject shall have the
right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of
consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent
before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall
be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.</p>
<p>4.When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost
account shall be taken of whether,<span class="comment">inter
alia</span>,
the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is
conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not
necessary for the performance of that contract. </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId573557"></a>2.
Contractual necessity</h3>
<p><span>processing
is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data
subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data
subject prior to entering into a contract</span> </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId402829"></a>3.
Legal obligation, vital interests and public interest</h3>
<p>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation
to which the controller is subject*; <br>
processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the
data subject or of another natural person; <br>
<span class="comment">Vital interests: concerning the
health of people</span> <br>
<span>processing
is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public
interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
controller*<br>
<span class="comment">Public interest: not limited to
official government authorities</span> <br>
<span class="comment">*
The basis for the processing referred to in point 1 and 3 shall be laid
down by: (a) Union law; or (b) Member State law to which the controller
is subject.</span></span> </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId238044"></a>4.
Legitimate interests</h3>
<p><span>processing
is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by
the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are
overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular
where the data subject is a child<br>
This </span><span>shall not apply to processing carried
out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.<br>
<br>
</span><span>Recital 47: </span><span>At
any rate the existence of a legitimate interest would need careful
assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at
the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that
processing for that purpose may take place. The interests and
fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the
interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in
circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect further
processing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br>
</span></span> </p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId443058"></a>5.
Special categories of processing</h3>
<p><span>Processing
of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the
processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely
identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning
a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.<br>
<br>
Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies:<br>
(a) the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of
those personal data for one or more specified purposes, except where
Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred to in
paragraph 1 may not be lifted by the data subject;<br>
(b) processing
is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and
exercising specific rights of the controller or of the data subject in
the field of employment and social security and social protection law
in so far as it is authorised by Union or Member State law or a
collective agreement pursuant to Member State law providing for
appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and the interests of
the data subject;<br>
(c) processing is necessary to protect the vital
interests of the data subject or of another natural person where the
data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent;<br>
(d) processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate
activities with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association or
any other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical,
religious or trade union aim and on condition that the processing
relates solely to the members or to former members of the body or to
persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its
purposes and that the personal data are not disclosed outside that body
without the consent of the data subjects;<br>
(e) processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made
public by the data subject;<br>
(f) processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence
of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial
capacity;<br>
(g) processing is necessary for reasons of substantial
public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law which shall
be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right
to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to
safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;<br>
(h) processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or
occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of
the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care
or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and
services on the basis of Union or Member State law or pursuant to
contract with a health professional and subject to the conditions and
safeguards referred to in paragraph 3;<br>
(i) processing is necessary
for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as
protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring
high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal
products or medical devices, on the basis of Union or Member State law
which provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the
rights and freedoms of the data subject, in particular professional
secrecy;<br>
(j) processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the
public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) based on Union or
Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued,
respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for
suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and
the interests of the data subject.<br>
3.Personal data referred to in
paragraph 1 may be processed for the purposes referred to in point (h)
of paragraph 2 when those data are processed by or under the
responsibility of a professional <span class="emphasis">subject

Information Provision Obligations </h2>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId820264"></a>1.
Transparency principle</h3>
<p>Article 12 <br>
<br>
Transparent information, communication and modalities for the exercise
of the rights of the data subject <br>
<br>
1.The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any
information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 and any communication
under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to processing to the data
subject in a <span class="emphasis">concise, transparent,
intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language</span>,
in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child.
The information shall be provided in writing, or by other means,
including, where appropriate, by electronic means. When requested by
the data subject, the information may be provided orally, provided that
the identity of the data subject is proven by other means. <br>
2.The controller shall <span class="emphasis">facilitate
the exercise of data subject rights </span>under
Articles 15 to 22. In the cases referred to in Article 11(2), the
controller shall not refuse to act on the request of the data subject
for exercising his or her rights under Articles 15 to 22, unless the
controller demonstrates that it is not in a position to identify the
data subject. <br>
3.The controller shall provide information on action
taken on a request under Articles 15 to 22 to the data subject without
undue delay and in any event <span class="emphasis">within
one month of receipt of the request</span>. That period may be <span
 class="emphasis">extended by two further months</span>
where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the
requests. The controller shall inform the data subject of any such
extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the
reasons for the delay. Where the data subject makes the request by
electronic form means, the information shall be provided by electronic
means where possible, unless otherwise requested by the data subject. <br>
4.If the controller does not take action on the request
of the data subject, the controller shall inform the data subject
without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the
request of the reasons for not taking action and on the possibility of
lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial
remedy. <br>
5.Information provided under Articles 13 and 14 and any
communication and any actions taken under Articles 15 to 22 and 34
shall be provided<span class="emphasis"> free of charge</span>.
Where
requests from a data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in
particular because of their repetitive character, the controller may
either: <br>
(a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the
administrative costs of providing the information or communication or
taking the action requested; or <br>
(b) refuse to act on the request. <br>
The controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating the manifestly
unfounded or excessive character of the request. <br>
6.Without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable
doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request
referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the
provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity
of the data subject. <br>
7.The information to be provided to data subjects
pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 may be provided in combination with
standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible
and clearly legible manner a meaningful overview of the intended
processing. Where the icons are presented electronically they shall be
machine-readable. <br>
8.The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated
acts in accordance with Article 92 for the purpose of determining the
information to be presented by the icons and the procedures for
providing standardised icons. </p>

Data Subjects Rights </h2>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId35199"></a>1.
Access</h3>

data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller
confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her
are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the
personal data and the following information: <br>
(a) the purposes of the processing; <br>
(b) the categories of personal data concerned; <br>
(c) the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data
have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third
countries or international organisations; <br>

personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to
determine that period; <br>
(e) the existence of the right to request from the
controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of
processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to
such processing; <br>
(f) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; <br>
(g) where the personal data are not collected from the data subject,
any available information as to their source; <br>

Breach notification</h3>
<p>Article 33: Notification of a personal data breach to the
supervisory authority <br>
1.In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without
undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having
become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory
authority competent in accordance with Article 55, unless the personal
data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms
of natural persons. Where the notification to the supervisory authority
is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the
delay. <br>
2.The processor shall notify the controller without undue delay after
becoming aware of a personal data breach. <br>
3.The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least: <br>
(a) describe the nature of the personal data breach including where
possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects
concerned and the categories and approximate number of personal data
records concerned; <br>
(b) communicate the name and contact details of the data
protection officer or other contact point where more information can be
obtained; <br>
(c) describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach; <br>

4.Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide
the information at the same time, the information may be provided in
phases without undue further delay. <br>
5.The controller shall document any personal data
breaches, comprising the facts relating to the personal data breach,
its effects and the remedial action taken. That documentation shall
enable the supervisory authority to verify compliance with this
Article. <br>
<br>
Article 34: Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject
<br>
1.When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to
the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall
communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue
delay. <br>
2.The communication to the data subject referred to in
paragraph 1 of this Article shall describe in clear and plain language
the nature of the personal data breach and contain at least the
information and measures referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of
Article 33(3). <br>
3.The communication to the data subject referred to in
paragraph 1 shall not be required if any of the following conditions
are met: <br>
(a) the controller has implemented appropriate technical
and organisational protection measures, and those measures were applied
to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in
particular those that render the personal data unintelligible to any
person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption; <br>
(b) the controller has taken subsequent measures which
ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects
referred to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to materialise; <br>
(c) it would involve disproportionate effort. In such a
case, there shall instead be a public communication or similar measure
whereby the data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner. <br>
4.If the controller has not already communicated the
personal data breach to the data subject, the supervisory authority,
having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting
in a high risk, may require it to do so or may decide that any of the
conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met. </p>

Responsibility of controllers and processors</h3>
<p><span>5.2: The controller shall be responsible for, and
be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).</span>
<br>
<span class="comment">This implies that if the controller
cannot demonstrate compliance, he can be fined just for that</span>
<br>
<br>
11: If the purposes for which a controller processes personal data do
not or do no longer require the identification of a data subject by the
controller, the controller shall not be obliged to maintain, acquire or
process additional information in order to identify the data subject
for the sole purpose of complying with this Regulation. </p>
<p>Where,
in cases referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the controller is
able to demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the data
subject, the controller shall inform the data subject accordingly, if
possible. In such cases, Articles 15 to 20 shall not apply except where
the data subject, for the purpose of exercising his or her rights under
those articles, provides additional information enabling his or her
identification. </p>
<p>Article 24: Responsibility of the controller <br>
1.Taking into account the <span class="emphasis">nature,
scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of
varying likelihood and severity</span> for the rights and
freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall implement <span
 class="emphasis">appropriate technical and organisational
measures </span>to
ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in
accordance with this Regulation. Those measures shall be reviewed and
updated where necessary. <br>
2. <span class="emphasis">Where proportionate </span>in
relation to processing activities, the measures referred to in
paragraph 1 shall include the implementation of appropriate <span
 class="emphasis">data protection policies</span> by
the controller. <br>
3.Adherence to approved <span class="emphasis">codes of
conduct as referred to in Article 40 or approved certification
mechanisms </span>as
referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to
demonstrate compliance with the obligations of the controller. <br>
Article 28: Processor <br>
1.Where processing
is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller shall
use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement
appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that
processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation and ensure the
protection of the rights of the data subject. <br>
2.The processor shall not engage another processor
without prior specific or general written authorisation of the
controller. In the case of general written authorisation, the processor
shall inform the controller of any intended changes concerning the
addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving the
controller the opportunity to object to such changes. <br>
3.Processing by a processor shall be governed by a
contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, that is
binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets
out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and
purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of
data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. That
contract or other legal act shall stipulate, in particular, that the
processor: <br>
(a) processes the personal data only on documented
instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers of
personal data to a third country or an international organisation,
unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which the
processor is subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the
controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law
prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest; <br>
(b) ensures that persons authorised to process the
personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under
an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality; <br>
(c) takes all measures required pursuant to Article 32; <br>
(d) respects the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 for
engaging another processor; <br>
(e) taking into account the nature of the processing, assists the
controller by appropriate technical and organisational measures,
insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the controller's
obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's
rights laid down in Chapter III; <br>
(f) assists the controller in ensuring compliance with
the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 taking into account the
nature of processing and the information available to the processor; <br>
(g) at the choice of the controller, deletes or returns
all the personal data to the controller after the end of the provision
of services relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless
Union or Member State law requires storage of the personal data; <br>
(h) makes available to the controller all information
necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in
this Article and allow for and contribute to audits, including
inspections, conducted by the controller or another auditor mandated by
the controller. <br>
With regard to point (h) of the first subparagraph, the
processor shall immediately inform the controller if, in its opinion,
an instruction infringes this Regulation or other Union or Member State
data protection provisions. <br>
4.Where a processor engages another processor for
carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the
controller, the same data protection obligations as set out in the
contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor as
referred to in paragraph 3 shall be imposed on that other processor by
way of a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law,
in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate
technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the
processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation. Where that
other processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, the
initial processor shall remain fully liable to the controller for the
performance of that other processor's obligations. <br>
5.Adherence of a processor to an approved code of
conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification
mechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by
which to demonstrate sufficient guarantees as referred to in paragraphs
1 and 4 of this Article. <br>
6.Without prejudice to an individual contract between
the controller and the processor, the contract or the other legal act
referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article may be based, in
whole or in part, on standard contractual clauses referred to in
paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article, including when they are part of a
certification granted to the controller or processor pursuant to
Articles 42 and 43. <br>
7.The Commission may lay down standard contractual
clauses for the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this
Article and in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in
Article 93(2). <br>
8.A supervisory authority may adopt standard contractual
clauses for the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this
Article and in accordance with the consistency mechanism referred to in
Article 63. <br>
9.The contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4
shall be in writing, including in electronic form. <br>
10.Without prejudice to Articles 82, 83 and 84, if a processor
infringes this Regulation by determining the purposes and means of
processing, the processor shall be considered to be a controller in
respect of that processing. <br>
<br>
Article 29: Processing under the authority of the controller or
processor <br>
The processor and any person acting under the authority of the

appropriate technical and organisational measures</span>, such as
pseudonymisation, which are <span class="emphasis">designed
to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimisation, i</span>n
an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the
processing in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and
protect the rights of data subjects. <br>
2.The controller shall implement appropriate technical
and organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only
personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the
processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of
personal data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of
their storage and their accessibility. In particular, such measures
shall ensure that by default personal data are not made accessible
without the individual's intervention to an indefinite number of
natural persons. <br>

Data protection impact assessment</h3>
<p>Article 35: Data protection impact assessment <br>
1.Where a type of processing<span class="emphasis"> in
particular using new technologies</span>, and taking into account
the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is <span
 class="emphasis">likely to result in a high risk to the
rights and freedoms of natural persons</span>, the controller
shall, prior to the processing, <span class="emphasis">carry
out an assessment of the impact </span>of
the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data.
A single assessment may address a set of similar processing operations
that present similar high risks. <br>
2.The controller shall seek the <span class="emphasis">advice
of the data protection officer</span>, where designated, when
carrying out a data protection impact assessment. <br>
3.A data protection impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall
in particular be required in the case of: <br>
(a) a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating
to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including <span
 class="emphasis">profiling,
and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning
the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person;</span>
<br>
(b) processing on a <span class="emphasis">large scale of
special categories of data</span> referred to in Article 9(1), or
of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred
to in Article 10; or <br>
(c) a <span class="emphasis">systematic monitoring of a
publicly accessible area</span> on a large scale. <br>
4.The <span class="emphasis">supervisory
authority shall establish and make public a list of the kind of
processing operations which are subject to the requirement for a data
protection impact assessment </span>pursuant to paragraph 1. The
supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board
referred to in Article 68. <br>
5.The supervisory authority may also establish and make public<span
 class="emphasis"> a list of the kind of processing
operations for which no data protection impact assessment is required</span>.
The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board. <br>
6.Prior to the adoption of the lists referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5,
the competent supervisory authority shall apply the consistency
mechanism referred to in Article 63 where such lists involve processing
activities which are related to the offering of goods or services to
data subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in several Member
States, or may substantially affect the free movement of personal data
within the Union. <br>
7.The assessment shall contain at least: <br>
(a) a <span class="emphasis">systematic description of
the envisaged processing operations and the purposes of the processing</span>,
including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the
controller; <br>
(b) an assessment of the <span class="emphasis">necessity
and proportionality </span>of the processing operations in
relation to the purposes; <br>
(c) an assessment of the <span class="emphasis">risks to
the rights and freedoms of data subjects </span>referred to in
paragraph 1; and <br>
(d) <span class="emphasis">the measures envisaged to
address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and
mechanisms to ensure the protection</span> of personal data <span
 class="emphasis">and to demonstrate compliance</span>
with this Regulation taking into account the rights and legitimate
interests of data subjects and other persons concerned. <br>
8. <span class="emphasis">Compliance with approved codes
of conduct</span>
referred to in Article 40 by the relevant controllers or processors
shall be taken into due account in assessing the impact of the
processing operations performed by such controllers or processors, in
particular for the purposes of a data protection impact assessment. <br>
9.Where appropriate, the <span class="emphasis">controller
shall seek the views of data subjects or their representatives on the
intended processing</span>, without prejudice to the protection
of commercial or public interests or the security of processing
operations. <br>
10.Where processing pursuant to point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1) has a
legal basis in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which the
controller is subject, that law regulates the specific processing
operation or set of operations in question, and a data protection
impact assessment has already been carried out as part of a general
impact assessment in the context of the adoption of that legal basis,
paragraphs 1 to 7 shall not apply unless Member States deem it to be
necessary to carry out such an assessment prior to processing
activities. <br>
11. <span class="emphasis">Where necessary, the
controller shall carry out a review to assess if processing is
performed in accordance with the data protection impact assessment </span>at
least when there is a change of the risk represented by processing
operations. <br>
<br>
Article 36: Prior consultation <br>
1. <span class="emphasis">The controller shall consult
the supervisory authority</span> prior to processing where a data
protection impact assessment under Article 35 indicates that the
processing would result in a <span class="emphasis">high
risk in the absence of measures</span> taken by the controller to
mitigate the risk. <br>
2.Where the supervisory authority is of the opinion that the intended
processing referred to in paragraph 1 would infringe this Regulation,
in particular <span class="emphasis">where the controller
has insufficiently identified or mitigated the risk,</span>
the supervisory authority shall, within period of up to eight weeks of
receipt of the request for consultation, provide written advice to the
controller and, where applicable to the processor, and may use any of
its powers referred to in Article 58. That period may be extended by
six weeks, taking into account the complexity of the intended
processing. The supervisory authority shall inform the controller and,
where applicable, the processor, of any such extension within one month
of receipt of the request for consultation together with the reasons
for the delay. Those periods may be suspended until the supervisory
authority has obtained information it has requested for the purposes of
the consultation. <br>
3.When consulting the supervisory authority pursuant to
paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the supervisory authority
with: <br>
(a) where applicable, the respective responsibilities of
the controller, joint controllers and processors involved in the
processing, in particular for processing within a group of
undertakings; <br>
(b) the purposes and means of the intended processing; <br>
(c) the measures and safeguards provided to protect the rights and
freedoms of data subjects pursuant to this Regulation; <br>
(d) where applicable, the contact details of the data protection
officer; <br>
(e) the data protection impact assessment provided for in Article 35;
and <br>
(f) any other information requested by the supervisory authority. <br>
4.Member States shall consult the supervisory authority during the
preparation of a proposal for a legislative measure to be adopted by a
national parliament, or of a regulatory measure based on such a
legislative measure, which relates to processing. <br>
5.Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Member State law may
require controllers to consult with, and obtain prior authorisation
from, the supervisory authority in relation to processing by a
controller for the performance of a task carried out by the controller
in the public interest, including processing in relation to social
protection and public health. </p>

Mandatory data protection officers</h3>
<p>Article 37: Designation of the data protection officer <br>
1.The controller and the processor shall designate a data protection
officer in any case where: <br>
(a) the processing is carried out by a public authority or body, except
for courts acting in their judicial capacity; <br>
(b) the <span class="emphasis">core activities</span>

Cross-Border Data Transfers </h2>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId59842"></a>1.
Rationale for prohibition</h3>
<p><span>Recital 101: Flows of personal data to and from
countries
outside the Union and international organisations are necessary for the
expansion of international trade and international cooperation. The
increase in such flows has raised new challenges and concerns with
regard to the protection of personal data. However, when personal data
are transferred from the Union to controllers, processors or other
recipients in third countries or to international organisations, the
level of protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this
Regulation should not be undermined, including in cases of onward
transfers of personal data from the third country or international
organisation to controllers, processors in the same or another third
country or international organisation. In any event, transfers to third
countries and international organisations may only be carried out in
full compliance with this Regulation. A transfer could take place only
if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions
laid down in the provisions of this Regulation relating to the transfer
of personal data to third countries or international organisations are
complied with by the controller or processor.</span></p>
<p><span>45:
A transfer of personal data to a third country or an international
organisation may take place where the Commission has decided that the
third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within that
third country, or the international organisation in question ensures an
adequate level of protection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">
<br>
<br>
46: In the absence of a decision pursuant to Article 45(3), a
controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country
or an international organisation only if the controller or processor
has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable
data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are
available.<br>
2.The appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph 1
may be provided for, without requiring any specific authorisation from
a supervisory authority, by:<br>
(a) a legally binding and enforceable instrument between public
authorities or bodies;<br>
(b) <span class="emphasis">binding corporate rules</span>
in accordance with Article 47; <br>
(c) <span class="emphasis">standard data protection
clauses</span> adopted by the Commission in accordance with the
examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2); <br>
(d) standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory authority
and approved by the Commission pursuant to the examination procedure
referred to in Article 93(2); <br>
(e) an approved code of conduct pursuant to Article 40
together with binding and enforceable commitments of the controller or
processor in the third country to apply the appropriate safeguards,
including as regards data subjects' rights; or <br>
(f) an approved certification mechanism pursuant to
Article 42 together with binding and enforceable commitments of the
controller or processor in the third country to apply the appropriate
safeguards, including as regards data subjects' rights. <br>

Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield</h3>
<p></p>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId850730"></a>Safe
Harbor</h4>
<p>The Safe Harbour Privacy Principles were developed between
1998-2000.
They were designed to prevent private organizations within the European
Union or United States which store customer data from accidentally
disclosing or losing personal information. US companies could opt into
a program and be certified if they adhered to seven principles and 15
frequently asked questions and answers per the Directive. In July 2000,
the European Commission (EC) decided that US companies complying with
the principles and registering their certification that they met the EU
requirements, the so-called "safe harbour scheme", were allowed to
transfer data from the EU to the US. This is referred to as the Safe
Harbour Decision. <br>
The seven principles from 2000 are: <br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Notice
- Individuals must be informed that their data is being collected and
how it will be used.The organization must provide information about how
individuals can contact the organization with any inquiries or
complaints.</li>
  <li>Choice - Individuals must have the option to opt out of the
collection and forward transfer of the data to third parties.</li>
  <li>Onward
Transfer - Transfers of data to third parties may only occur to other
organizations that follow adequate data protection principles. </li>
  <li>Security - Reasonable efforts must be made to prevent loss
of collected information.</li>
  <li>Data Integrity - Data must be relevant and reliable for the
purpose it was collected.</li>
  <li>Access - Individuals must be able to access information
held about them, and correct or delete it, if it is inaccurate.</li>
  <li>Enforcement - There must be effective means of enforcing
these rules.</li>
</ol>
<p>The EU-US Safe Harbour Principles 'self certification scheme'
has been
criticised in regard to their compliance and enforcement in three
external EU evaluations <br>

 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Principles">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Principles</a>
<br>
'Safe Harbor' is now defunct because the European Court of Justice
found the following: <br>
(a) There is no general privacy law or other measures enacted in the US
that shows the US offers "an adequate level of protection" for personal
data relating to European data subjects; <br>
(b) Public law enforcement authorities which obtain
personal data from organisations in Safe Harbor are not obliged to
follow the 'Safe Harbor' rules after disclosure; <br>
(c) Some US law enforcement agencies can gain access to
personal data in 'Safe Harbor' without having any law that legitimises
their access; and <br>
(d) The European Commission knew all the above and knew
that personal data was possibly being used for incompatible and
disproportionate purposes by law enforcement agencies. <br>
If you read<a href="#ECHR_Article_8.2"> Article 8(2) of
the Human Rights Convention</a>, you will get the ECJ Judgment
immediately. <br>
<br>
As Snowden's leaks showed, there is no law legitimising the
interference by the National Security Agencies, so one does not know
whether any interference on their part is necessary. Source: <a

<br>
<br>
'Safe Harbor' is unsafe because such agencies in the USA can access
personal data without due process, and because the US has no law that
limits the use of personal data by them. <br>
<br>
On 6 October 2015, the Court of Justice of
the European Union declared the Commission’s 2000 Decision on EU-US
Safe Harbour invalid. <br>
On 6 November 2015 the European Commission adopted a
Communication on the Transfer of Personal Data from the EU to the
United States of America under Directive 95/46/EC following the
Judgment by the Court of Justice in Case C-362/14 (Schrems). The aim
was to provide an overview of the alternative tools for transatlantic
data transfers in the absence of an adequacy decision. <br>
On 29 February 2016, the Commission published a draft adequacy decision
and the relevant commitments by U.S. authorities. <br>
On 13 April 2016, the Article 29 Working Party issued its opinion:

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId168539"></a>The
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield</h4>
<p> The Commission adopted on 12 July 2016 its decision on the
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. <br>
This new framework protects the fundamental rights of anyone in the EU
whose personal data is transferred to the United States as well as
bringing legal clarity for businesses relying on transatlantic data
transfers. The new arrangement includes: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>strong data protection obligations on companies receiving
personal data from the EU</li>
  <li>safeguards on U.S. government access to data;</li>
  <li>effective protection and redress for individuals;</li>
  <li>annual joint review to monitor the implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Privacy Shield allows your personal data to be transferred
from the
EU to a company in the United States, provided that the company there
processes (e.g. uses, stores and further transfers) your personal data
according to a strong set of data protection rules and safeguards. The
protection given to your data applies regardless of whether you are an
EU citizen or not. <br>
<br>
To transfer personal data from the EU to
the U.S. different tools are available such as contractual clauses,
binding corporate rules and the Privacy Shield. If the Privacy Shield
is used, U.S. companies must first sign up to this framework with the
U.S. Department of Commerce. The obligation applying to companies under
the Privacy Shield are contained in the “Privacy Principles”. This
Department is responsible for managing and administering the Privacy
Shield and ensuring that companies live up to their commitments. In
order to be able to certify, companies must have a privacy policy in
line with the Privacy Principles. They must renew their “membership” to
the Privacy Shield on an annual basis. If they do not, they can no
longer receive and use personal data from the EU under that framework. <br>
<br>
If you want to know if a company in the
U.S. is part of the Privacy Shield, you can check the Privacy Shield
List on the website of the Department of Commerce (<a
 href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome</a>).
This list will give you details of all the companies taking part in the
Privacy Shield, the kind of personal data they use, and the kind of
services they offer. You can also find a list of companies that are no
longer part of the Privacy Shield. This means they are no longer
allowed to receive your personal data under the Privacy Shield. Also,
these companies may only keep your personal data if they commit to the
Department of Commerce that they will continue to apply the Privacy
Principles. <br>
<br>
The Privacy Shield provides you with a
number of rights and companies are obliged to protect your personal
data in line with the “Privacy Principles”. <br>
1. Your right to be informed <br>
2. Limitations on the use of your data for different purposes <br>
3. Data minimisation and obligation to keep your data only for the time
needed <br>
4. Obligation to secure your data <br>
5. Obligation to protect your data if transferred to another company <br>
6. Your right to access and correct your data <br>
7. Your right to lodge a complaint and obtain a remedy <br>
8. Redress in case of access by U.S. public authorities <br>
<br>
as an individual you have several possibilities to lodge a complaint,
namely with the: <br>
1. U.S. Privacy Shield company itself; <br>
2. Independent recourse mechanism, such as ADR or DPA; <br>
3. U.S. Department of Commerce, only through a DPA; <br>
4. U.S. Federal Trade Commission (or the U.S. Department of
Transportation if complaint relates to an airline or ticket agent); <br>
5. Privacy Shield Panel, only once certain other redress options have
failed. <br>
<br>
While existing U.S. law provides you with protections and remedies in
the law enforcement area, the Privacy Shield framework for the first
time creates a special instrument to address national security access,
the so-called Ombudsperson mechanism. The Privacy Shield Ombudsperson
is a senior official within the U.S. Department of State who is
independent from U.S. intelligence agencies. Assisted by a number of
staff, the Ombudsperson will ensure that complaints are properly
investigated and addressed in a timely manner, and that you receive
confirmation that the relevant U.S. laws have been complied with or, if
the laws have been violated, the situation has been remedied. In
carrying out its duties, and following up on the complaints received,
the Ombudsperson will work closely with and obtain all the information
from other independent oversight and investigatory bodies necessary for
its response when it concerns the compatibility of surveillance with
U.S. law. These bodies are the ones responsible to oversee the various
U.S. intelligence agencies. <br>

<br>
Some of the differences with Safe Harbor: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Safeguards
related to intelligence activities will extend to all data transferred
to the U.S., regardless of the transfer mechanism used.</li>
  <li>The
Shield’s dispute resolution framework provides multiple avenues for
individuals to lodge complaints, more than those available under the
Safe Harbor and alternative transfer mechanisms such as Standard
Contractual Clauses or Binding Corporate Rules.</li>
  <li>An
organization’s compliance with the Privacy Shield will be directly and
indirectly monitored by a wider array of authorities in the U.S. and
the EU, possibly increasing regulatory risks and compliance costs for
participating organizations.</li>
  <li>The Department of
Commerce will significantly expand its role in monitoring and
supervising compliance, including by carrying out ex officio compliance
reviews and investigations of participating organizations. </li>
  <li>Participating
organizations will be subjected to additional compliance and reporting
obligations, some of which will continue even after they withdraw from
the Privacy Shield.</li>

Model contracts</h3>
<p><span class="comment">These are the standard data
protection clauses mentioned in article 46.</span> <br>
At the EU level, the European Commission with the assistance of the
Article 29 Working Party developed standard contractual clauses which
were officially certified by a Commission Decision as proof of adequate
data protection. <br>
The most important features of the standard contractual clauses are: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a
third-party beneficiary clause which enables data subjects to exercise
contractual rights even though they are not a party to the contract;</li>
  <li>the
data recipient or importer agreeing to be subject to the procedure of
the data-exporting controller’s national supervisory authority and/or
courts in case of dispute.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are now two
sets of standard clauses for controller-to-controller transfers
available, from which the data-exporting controller can choose.For
controller-to processor transfers, there is only one set of standard
contractual clauses <br>

Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)</h3>
<p>Multilateral
binding corporate rules (BCRs) very often involve several European data
protection authorities at the same time.235 In order for BCRs to be
approved, the draft of the BCRs must be sent together with the
standardised application forms to the lead authority.236 The lead
authority is identifiable from the standardised application form. This
authority then informs all of the supervisory authorities in EEA member
countries where affiliates of the group are established, although their

<br>
Article 41: Monitoring of approved codes of conduct <br>
1.Without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the competent
supervisory authority under Articles 57 and 58, the monitoring of
compliance with a code of conduct pursuant to Article 40 may be carried
out by a body which has an appropriate level of expertise in relation
to the subject-matter of the code and is accredited for that purpose by
the competent supervisory authority. <br>
2.A body as referred to in paragraph 1 may be accredited to monitor
compliance with a code of conduct where that body has: <br>
(a) demonstrated its independence and expertise in relation to the
subject-matter of the code to the satisfaction of the competent
supervisory authority; <br>
(b) established procedures which allow it to assess the
eligibility of controllers and processors concerned to apply the code,
to monitor their compliance with its provisions and to periodically
review its operation; <br>
(c) established procedures and structures to handle
complaints about infringements of the code or the manner in which the
code has been, or is being, implemented by a controller or processor,
and to make those procedures and structures transparent to data
subjects and the public; and <br>

supervisory authorities which are competent pursuant to Article 55 or
56. <br>
5.A certification pursuant to this Article shall be
issued by the certification bodies referred to in Article 43 or by the
competent supervisory authority, on the basis of criteria approved by
that competent supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(3) or by
the Board pursuant to Article 63. Where the criteria are approved by

pursuant to Article 46</span>,
including binding corporate rules, a transfer or a set of transfers of
personal data to a third country or an international organisation shall
take place only on one of the following conditions: <br>

consented</span>
to the proposed transfer, after having been informed of the possible
risks of such transfers for the data subject due to the absence of an

public and which is open to consultation</span>
either by the public in general or by any person who can demonstrate a
legitimate interest, but only to the extent that the conditions laid

of the transfer. The controller shall, in addition to providing the
information referred to in Articles 13 and 14,<span class="emphasis">

: the EDPS monitors the processing of personal data in the EU
administration and ensures compliance with the data protection rules.
The supervisory tasks&nbsp; range from prior checking processing
operations likely to present specific risks, to handling complaints and
conducting enquiries.</li>
  <li>Consultation : the EDPS advises the
European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council on
proposals for new legislation and a wide range of other issues having
an impact on data protection.</li>
  <li>Cooperation : the EDPS cooperates
with other data protection authorities in order to promote consistent
data protection throughout Europe. The central platform for cooperation
with national data protection authorities is the Article 29 Working
Party. </li>
</ul>
<p>SUPERVISION AND ENFORCEMENT<br>
<br>
One of the
EDPS' main tasks is to supervise personal data processing by
the&nbsp;
European institutions and bodies . This supervision work takes various
forms.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The bulk of it is based on notifications of
processing operations presenting specific risks. These need to be prior
checked by the EDPS. Based on the facts submitted to him, the EDPS will
examine the processing of personal data in relation to the Data
Protection Regulation ( Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 ). In most cases,
this exercise leads to a set of recommendations that the institution or
body need to implement so as to ensure compliance with data protection
rules.</li>
  <li>The EDPS receives complaints from EU staff members as
well as from other people who feel that their personal data have been
mishandled by a European institution or body. If a complaint is
admissible, the EDPS usually carries out an inquiry. The findings are
communicated to the complainant, and necessary measures are adopted.</li>
  <li>The EDPS may adopt opinions on administrative measures
related to data protection adopted by European institutions and bodies.</li>
  <li>The
EDPS may carry out inquiries on his own initiative. Inquiries and
inspections are essential for a supervisory authority to have the means
for fact-finding, following up of cases and monitoring of compliance in
general. </li>
  <li>In order to monitor compliance with Regulation (EC)
No 45/2001, the EDPS largely relies on the Data Protection Officers
(DPOs) who are to be appointed in each institution/body. Apart from
bilateral meetings and contacts with the DPOs, the EDPS also takes part
in the regular meetings of the DPO network.</li>
  <li>Since January 2004,
the EDPS has ensured the supervision of the central unit of Eurodac. An
essential aspect of this supervision is the cooperation with national
supervisory authorities and the drawing up recommendations for common
solutions to existing problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>The EDPS publishes thematic
guidelines on critical issues to serve as reference documents for the
European administration.In December 2010 the EDPS adopted a policy
paper entitled: "Monitoring and Ensuring Compliance with Regulation
(EC) 45/2001".</p>
<p>CONSULTATION<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The EDPS
advises the EU institutions and bodies on data protection issues in a
range of policy areas. His consultative role relates to proposals for
new legislation, as well as soft law instruments (e.g. communications)
that affect personal data protection in the EU. He also monitors new
technologies that may have an impact on data protection. The objective
is to ensure that the EU citizens' fundamental rights to protection of
privacy and personal data are maintained, while society evolves.</li>
  <li>One
of the primary tasks of the EDPS is to examine the data protection and
privacy impact of proposed new legislation. The EDPS Policy paper of
2014 elaborates on how this role is interpreted in terms of limitations
in scope, working methods and main orientations. The EDPS uses
different instruments in order to exercise this role.</li>
  <li>The first
instrument is a planning tool. Each year in December, the EDPS
publishes an inventory of his priorities for the coming year. It lists
the most relevant Commission proposals, which may require a formal
reaction by the EDPS. Those proposals that are expected to have a
strong impact on data protection are given high priority. This may also
apply to research projects.</li>
  <li>The second and most important
instrument is the formal public opinion . By issuing opinions on a
regular basis, the EDPS establishes a consistent policy on data
protection issues. The opinions are addressed to those involved in the
legislative negotiations, but also published on the website as well as
in the Official Journal of the EU. </li>
  <li>A third instrument of
intervention is the EDPS comments , which address data protection
issues for instance in Commission communications.</li>
  <li>A final
instrument is the possibility to intervene in cases before the Court of
Justice, the Court of First Instance and the Civil Service Tribunal.</li>
</ul>
<p> COOPERATION<br>
<br>
<br>
The
third leg of EDPS' activities can best be described as cooperation. It
covers work on specific issues, such as the interpretation of the EU
Data Protection Directive, as well as more structural collaboration
together with other data protection authorities. The overriding aim of
the EDPS is to promote consistency in the protection of personal data
throughout the EU.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The central forum for cooperation in
the EU is the Article 29 Working Party . This is where the national
data protection authorities meet to exchange views on current issues,
to discuss a common interpretation of data protection legislation and
to give expert advice to the European Commission.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>The
EDPS also participates in the work to ensure good data protection in
the EU's third pillar, which covers police and judicial cooperation
(formerly "EU's third pillar"). This includes attending a number of
meetings of the Joint Supervisory Bodies with deal with information
systems in the area of police and justice. He is also a member of the
Working Party on Police and Justice set up by the European Conference
to provide advice in the area of law enforcement.</li>
  <li>One of the
most important cooperative tasks relates to the large scale IT system
Eurodac , where the responsibilities for data protection supervision
are shared. The system consists of national units (subject to national
law), and a central unit (subject to the EU Data Protection
Regulation). It therefore requires a coordinated approach that is
developed through biannual coordination meetings organised by the
EDPS.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Two major data protection conferences are
organised each year. Every spring, a European Conference gathers data
protection officials from authorities in the Member States of the EU
and the Council of Europe. And every autumn, a wide range of data
protection experts, from the public as well as the private sector,
meets for the International Conference .&nbsp; </li>
  <li>International
organisations which are exempted from national law, often find
themselves without a legal framework for data protection. Because all
of them process personal data, the EDPS took the initiative in 2005 of
organising a workshop on 'data protection as part of good governance in
international organisations' with representatives from some 20
organisations. Two follow-up workshops have been organised since then.</li>

2.Administrative fines shall, depending on the
circumstances of each individual case, be imposed in addition to, or
instead of, measures referred to in points (a) to (h) and (j) of
Article 58(2). When deciding whether to impose an administrative fine
and deciding on the amount of the administrative fine in each
individual case due regard shall be given to the following: <br>

previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned
with regard to the same subject-matter, compliance with those measures;
<br>
(j) adherence to approved codes of conduct pursuant to
Article 40 or approved certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42;
and <br>
(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor
applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits
gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the
infringement. <br>
3.If a controller or processor intentionally or
negligently, for the same or linked processing operations, infringes
several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the

Employment Relationship </h2>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId617740"></a>1.
Legal basis for processing of employee data</h3>
<p>Context: Data Protection Regulation</p>
<ul>
  <li>PROCESSING
IS NECESSARY FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF A CONTRACT TO WHICH THE DATA
SUBJECT IS PARTY… Employment relationships are very often based on a
contract of employment between the employer and worker. To meet its
obligations under the contract to, for example, pay the worker, the
employer must process some personal data.</li>
  <li>PROCESSING
IS NECESSARY FOR COMPLIANCE WITH A LEGAL OBLIGATION… (ARTICLE 7.1.C)
The employer may be under a legal obligation to make certain
disclosures of personal data, for example, to the tax authorities or to
process data or in connection with social security payments. </li>
  <li>PROCESSING
IS NECESSARY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS PURSUED BY
THE CONTROLLER OR BY THE THIRD PARTY OR PARTIES TO WHOM THE DATA ARE
DISCLOSED, EXCEPT WHERE SUCH INTERESTS ARE OVERRIDDEN BY THE INTERESTS
FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF THE DATA SUBJECT … (Article
7.1.F). This criterion requires a balance to be struck between the
interests of the employer and the interests of workers. Some
supervisory authorities have issued guidance on how the balance between
the interests of the data controller and the interests of the data
subject should be struck. It is important to remember that if this
criterion is relied on the worker retains the right to object to the
processing on compelling legitimate grounds (Article 14).</li>
  <li>PROCESSING
IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE VITAL INTERESTS OF THE DATA
SUBJECT. (Article 7.1.D) This may be relevant in the context of the
protection of safety. </li>
  <li>PROCESSING IS NECESSARY FOR
THE PERFORMANCE OF A TASK CARRIED OUT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST…. 16
(Article 7.1.E). The circumstances, in which this criterion is relevant
in the employment context, are likely to be very limited. </li>
</ul>
<p>If
none of the criteria are applicable to the processing of a worker’s
data by an employer, the employer can, alternatively, obtain the
worker’s unambiguous consent to the processing.. However:</p>
<p>THE
ARTICLE 29 WORKING PARTY TAKES THE VIEW THAT WHERE AS A NECESSARY AND
UNAVOIDABLE CONSEQUENCE OF THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP AN EMPLOYER HAS
TO PROCESS PERSONAL DATA IT IS MISLEADING IF IT SEEKS TO LEGITIMISE
THIS PROCESSING THROUGH CONSENT. RELIANCE ON CONSENT SHOULD BE CONFINED
TO CASES WHERE THE WORKER HAS A GENUINE FREE CHOICE AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY
ABLE TO WITHDRAW THE CONSENT WITHOUT DETRIMENT. </p>
<p><span class="comment">The problem here is the
worker - employer relationship, which is not balanced.</span>
The Article 29 Working Party takes the view that where consent is
required from a worker, and there is a real or potential relevant
prejudice that arises from not consenting, the consent is not valid in
terms of satisfying either Article 7 or Article 8 as it is not freely
given. If it is not possible for the worker to refuse it is not
consent. Consent must at all times be freely given. Thus a worker must
be able to withdraw consent without prejudice.</p>
<p>Not all
manual records necessarily fall within the Directive’s scope. They only
do so if they form part of a ‘personal data filing system’. This is
defined as any structured set of personal data, which are accessible
according to specific criteria, whether centralised, decentralised or
dispersed on a functional or geographical basis. </p>
<p>Source: WP 29 opinion 15: (source <a
 href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/docs/wpdocs/2011/wp187_en.pdf">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/docs/wpdocs/2011/wp187_en.pdf)</a>
</p>
<p><span class="comment">There
is no uniform European law governing the use of personal data by
employers. Each member state has different national laws. Many
countries have embedded the right to privacy in their constitution (not
the UK), but how it should apply to employer-employee relationships is
not determined by it. Many countries have adapted additional (labour)
laws that are specificly describing what is or isn't allowed, and DPA's
have issued guidelines and opinions about it.<br>
<br>
Relevancy<br>
Throughout the Member States, the main labour law principle to be found
is the principle of relevancy. It implies that the employer’s right to
investigate is not absolute. It is designed to strike a balance between
the respective legitimate interests that exist in the context of
employment privacy. The relevancy-test is made, implying that the
employer’s may only exercise his right to information – or his right to
investigate and collect information – in so far as these collections or
investigations are relevant for the employment.<br>
<br>
Proportionality<br>
The principle of relevancy may also give rise to a proportionality test
in various cases.<br>
<br>
‘tendency companies’, are companies which are biased or show a certain
social, ideological, political, religious, … affinity. Religious
organisations are a clear example, like political parties, or various
non-profit organisations. For such organisations, the employer’s
interest in collecting specific personal and sensitive information may
increase in relation to the specific biased (but legitimate) business
purposes. The ban on investigations would be lifted only for employees
performing tasks that are directly linked to the employer’s ideological
stance. For employees performing non-ideological functions, employer’s
investigations would continue to be illegal.<br>

</p>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId630494"></a>2.
Storage of personnel records </h3>
<p>The
employer must implement appropriate technical and organisational
measures at the workplace to guarantee that the personal data of his
workers is kept secured. Particular protection should be granted as
regards unauthorised disclosure or access. Personal data must remain
safe from the curiosity of other workers or third parties. Nowadays,
the technology offers reasonable means for preventing such unauthorised
access or disclosure, allowing in any case the identification of the
staff accessing the files. Where a data processor is used, there must
be a contract between the employer and the third party providing
security guarantees and ensuring that the processor acts only on the
employer’s instructions. </p>
<p><span class="comment">Also, the
usual yada yada applies: finality, transparency, legitimacy,
proportionality, accuracy and retention of the data, security,

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId559226"></a>3.
Workplace monitoring and data loss prevention </h3>
<p>Contect:
In considering the question of surveillance, it must always be borne in
mind that while workers have a right to a certain degree of privacy in
the workplace, this right must be balanced against the right of the
employer to control the functioning of his business and defend himself
against workers' action likely to harm employers' legitimate interests,
for example the employer’s liability for the action of their workers. </p>
<p>It
must be emphasised moreover that the conditions of work have evolved in
the way that it becomes more difficult today to clearly separate work
hours from private life. In particular, as “home office” is developing,
many workers continue their work at home using computer infrastructure
provided by the employer for that purpose or not.</p>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId132514"></a>Legal
instruments</h4>
<p>Article
8 and 10 of the European Convention For The Protection Of Human Rights
And Fundamental Freedoms (right to respect for his private and family
life, his home and correspondence, and freedom of expression</p>
<p>In
the judgements given to date, the Court has made it clear that the
protection of "private life" enshrined in Article 8 does not exclude
the professional life as a worker and is not limited to life within
home. The case Niemitz v. Germany concerned the search by a government
authority of the complainant's office.[...] The court stated "There
appears, furthermore, to be no reason of principle why this
understanding of the notion of "private life" should be taken to
exclude activities of a professional or business nature"</p>
<p>More
precisely in the case of Halford v. the United Kingdom the Court
decided that interception of workers' phone calls at work constituted a
violation of Article 8 of the Convention. In the Court's view "it is
clear from its case-law that telephone calls made from business
premises as well as from the home may be covered by the notions of
"private life" and "correspondence" within the meaning of Article 8
paragraph 1 (…). There is no evidence of any warning having been given
to Ms Halford, as a user of the internal telecommunications system that
calls made on that system would be liable to interception. She would,
the Court considers, have had a reasonable expectation of privacy for
such calls…"</p>
<p>More generally, three principles can be
extracted from the case law on Article 8 of the European Convention for
the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms: </p>
<ul>
  <li>a)
Workers have a legitimate expectation of privacy at the workplace,
which is not overridden by the fact that workers use communication
devices or any other business facilities of the employer. However the
provision of proper information by the employer to the worker may
reduce the workers legitimate expectation of privacy. </li>
  <li>b)
The general principle of secrecy of correspondence covers
communications at the workplace. This is likely to include electronic
e-mail and related files attached thereto. </li>
  <li>c)
Respect for private life also includes to a certain degree the right to
establish and develop relationships with other human beings. The fact
that such relationships, to a great extent, take place at the workplace
puts limits to employer's legitimate need for surveillance measures</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId805939"></a>Surveillance
And Monitoring Of Electronic Communications In
The Work Place Under Directive 95/46/EC: Principles</h4>
<ul>
  <li>NECESSITY
This principle means that the employer must check if any form of
monitoring is absolutely necessary for a specified purpose before
proceeding to engage in any such activity. Traditional methods of
supervision, less intrusive for the privacy of individuals, should be
carefully considered and where appropriate implemented before engaging
in any monitoring of electronic communications. It would only be in
exceptional circumstances that the monitoring of a workers mail or
Internet use would be considered necessary. For instance, monitoring of
a worker’s e-mail may become necessary in order to obtain confirmation
or proof of certain actions on his 14
http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/en/dataprot/wpdocs/wp48en.pdf
14 part. Such actions would include criminal activity on the part of
the worker insofar as it is necessary for the employer to defend his
own interests, for example, where he is vicariously liable for the
actions of the worker.</li>
  <li> FINALITY. This principle
means that data must be collected for a specified, explicit and
legitimate purpose and not further processed in a way incompatible with
those purposes. </li>
  <li> TRANSPARENCY This principle means
that an employer must be clear and open about his activities. It means
that no covert e-mail monitoring is allowed by employers except in
those cases where a law in the Member State under Article 13 of the
Directive allows for that. This is most likely to be the case where
specific criminal activity has been identified. This principle can be
divided into two <span class="comment">(well, three
actually)</span> aspects:
    <ul>
      <li>THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE DATA
SUBJECT It means that
the employer has to provide his workers with a readily accessible,
clear and accurate statement of his policy with regard to e-mail and
Internet monitoring</li>
      <li>THE OBLIGATION TO NOTIFY
SUPERVISORY AUTHORITIES BEFORE CARRYING OUT ANY WHOLLY OR PARTLY
AUTOMATIC PROCESSING OPERATION OR SET OF SUCH PROCESSING OPERATIONS.
This is another way of providing transparency as workers can always
check in the Data Protection registers, for instance, what categories
of data, for what purposes and for what recipients is the employer
supposed to process the personal data of their employees.</li>
      <li>RIGHT
OF ACCESS A Worker, as any other individuals under the Directive17, has
a right of access to the personal data related to him processed by his
employer and where appropriate, request its rectification or erasure or
blocking which does not comply with the provisions of the Directive, in
particular because of the incomplete or inaccurate nature of the data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>LEGITIMACY
This principle means that any data processing operation can only take
place if it has a legitimate purpose as provided for in Article 7 of
the Directive and the national legislation transposing it. [...] The
processing of sensitive data connected to monitoring activities and
surveillance is a difficult issue, which is not only relevant for the
employment context. Indeed is a general issue on which the Working
Party may provide some guidance in the future. As a matter of fact,
unless specifically authorised by national law providing for adequate
safeguards, monitoring activities directly aimed at the processing of
sensitive data of workers would not find a legitimisation under the
provisions of Directive 95/46/EC and would not be acceptable. However,
preventing or making very difficult any monitoring activities (which in
many cases are not only lawful but even also desirable such as those
directly aimed at guaranteeing the security of the system), by the
simple fact that the processing of certain sensitive data might be
unavoidable involved, does not seem acceptable either.</li>
  <li>PROPORTIONALITY
This principle requires that personal data including those involved in
monitoring must be adequate, relevant and not excessive with regard to
achieving the purpose specified. The proportionality principle
therefore rules out blanket monitoring of individual e-mails and
Internet use of all staff other than where necessary for the purpose of
ensuring the security of the system. The monitoring of e-mails should,
if possible, be limited to traffic data on the participants and time of
a communication rather than the contents of communications if this
would suffice to allay the employers concerns. If access to the
e-mail’s content is absolutely necessary, account should be taken of
the privacy of those outside the organisation receiving them as well as
those inside. The employer, for instance, cannot obtain the consent of
those outside the organisation sending e-mails to his workers. The
employer should make reasonable efforts to inform those outside the
organisation of the existence of monitoring activities to the extent
that people outside the organisation could be affected by them. A
practical example could be the insertion of warning notices regarding
18 the existence of the monitoring systems, which may be added to all
outbound messages from the organisation. </li>
  <li>ACCURACY AND RETENTION OF DATA It is hard to see that a
retention period longer of three months would be normally justified. </li>
  <li>SECURITY
It also encompasses the right of the employer to protect his system
against viruses and may involve the automated scanning of e-mails and
network traffic data. The Working Party is of the opinion that, in view
of the importance of maintaining a secure system, such automated
opening of e-mails should not be considered as violating the worker’s
right to privacy, provided that appropriate safeguards are put in
place. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Article 29 Working Party draws
attention to the role of the system administrator, a worker who holds
important responsibilities from the data protection point of view. It
is of great importance that the system administrator and anyone else
who has access to personal data about workers in the course of
monitoring, is placed under a strict duty of professional secrecy with
regard to confidential information, to which they have access.</p>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId508034"></a>E-mail
monitoring</h4>
<p>The
Article 29 Working Party is of the view that electronic communications
made from business premises may be covered by the notions of "private
life" and "correspondence" within the meaning of Article 8 paragraph 1
of the European Convention. There is little margin for interpretation
as this respect as this issue has been clearly settled by the Court in
the case Halford v. the United Kingdom mentioned above.</p>
<p>The
most likely legitimisation for e-mail monitoring can be found in
Article 7 (f) of the Directive, that is, where processing is necessary
for the purposes of the legitimate interest pursued by the controller
or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed</p>
<p>WP29
advises to use a separate email account for personal use, so that the
distinction between private and professional correspondence is more
clear. </p>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId892971"></a>Monitoring
of Internet access</h4>
<p>Wherever possible prevention should be more important than
detection. </p>
<p>The
delivering of prompt information to the worker on the detection of a
suspicious use of the Internet is important in order to minimise
problems Even if a necessary measure, any monitoring must be a
proportionate response to the risk faced by the employer. In most cases
Internet misuse can be detected without the necessity of analysing the
content of the sites visited. For example, a check on the time spent,
or a check on the sites most frequently visited by a department may
suffice to reassure an employer that their facilities are not being
misused. </p>
<p>When assessing Internet use by workers employers
should try to exercise caution in coming to conclusions, taking into
account the ease with which websites can be visited unwittingly through
unintended responses of search engines, unclear hypertext links,
misleading banner advertising and miskeying. In any case, workers must
have the facts presented to them and be given full opportunity to
contest the misuse alleged by the employer. </p>

works councils. A work council is a body of people representing the
personnel of a company. The Works council represents the personnel when
decisions are made that concern the personnel. In different countries,
different rules apply to the rights and duties of an employer and a

Whistleblowing systems </h3>
<p>Source: WP 29 Opinion 117 (<span><a
 href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/docs/wpdocs/2006/wp117_en.pdf">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/docs/wpdocs/2006/wp117_en.pdf</a>)
</span> </p>
<p><span>When
blowing the whistle, the whistleblower processes personal data of the
accused. When doing so, the whistleblower is vulnerable and needs to be
protected, and this also goes for his personal data. At the same time,
the accused has his data subject rights, but they may conflict with the
interest of the company to investigate the accusations. The opinion
makes a couple of observations:</span> </p>
<ul>
  <li><span>There
must be a legal basis for whistleblowing schemes. For certain
industries such as banking, there is a legal obligation to establish a
whistleblower scheme. In case there is no such obligation, there may
still be a legitimate interest, but in this case </span>"Such a
reason
would only be acceptable on condition that such legitimate interests
are not overridden by the interests for fundamental rights and freedoms
of the data subject”.</li>
  <li>Application of the principles of data quality and
proportionality
    <ul>
      <li>Possible
limit on the number of persons entitled to report. Processed data must
be adequate, relevant and not excessive. This might mean a company may
restrict who has the right to file a whistleblower report to prevent
accusations of issues that are not serious enough to justify invasion
of the privacy of the accused</li>
      <li>Possible limit on
the number of persons who may be incriminated. This is to prevent that
people may be incriminated for things that are not serious enough to
justify invasion of the privacy of the accused</li>
      <li>Anonymous
reporting may lead to problems (more difficult to investigate,
malevolent reporting, people may still guess who the whistleblower is).
Also, anonymous reports raise a specific problem with regard to the
essential requirement that personal data should only be collected
fairly. Therefore, the rule should be that whistleblowing reports
should not as a rule be submitted anonymously. Anonymous reporting may
still happen because of various reasons. The Working Party considers
that whistleblowing schemes should be built in such a way that they do
not encourage anonymous reporting as the usual way to make a complaint.
The processing of anonymous reports must be subject to special caution.</li>
      <li>Companies setting up these systems should clearly
define the type of
information to be disclosed through the system, by limiting the type of
information to [the purpose of the whistleblower scheme]</li>
      <li>Personal
data processed by a whistleblowing scheme should be deleted, promptly,
and usually within two months of completion of the investigation of the
facts alleged in the report. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Provision
of clear and complete information about the scheme (Article 10): The
requirement of clear and complete information on the system obliges the
controller to inform data subjects about the existence, purpose and
functioning of the scheme, the recipients of the reports and the right
of access, rectification and erasure for reported persons. Data
controllers should also provide information on the fact that the
identity of the whistleblower shall be kept confidential throughout the
whole process and that abuse of the system may result in action against
the perpetrator of the abuse. </li>
  <li>Rights of the incriminated person:
    <ul>
      <li>Information
rights: the reported employee must be informed about: [1] the entity
responsible for the whistleblowing scheme, [2] the facts he is accused
of, [3] the departments or services which might receive the report
within his own company or in other entities or companies of the group
of which the company is part, and [4] how to exercise his rights of
access and rectification. However, where there is substantial risk that
such notification would jeopardise the ability of the company to
effectively investigate the allegation or gather the necessary
evidence, notification to the incriminated individual may be delayed as
long as such risk exists. </li>
      <li>Rights of access,
rectification and erasure: Under no circumstances can the person
accused in a whistleblower’s report obtain information about the
identity of the whistleblower from the scheme on the basis of the
accused person’s right of access, except where the whistleblower
maliciously makes a false statement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Security
of processing operations: security measures must be proportionate to
the purposes, confidentiality of reports is an essential requirement</li>
  <li>A
specific organisational must be set up within the company or the group
dedicated to handling whistleblowers’ reports and leading the
investigation. External service providers for reporting or
investigation may be used, if the comply with the principles of the
privacy law Principle of investigation in the EU for EU companies,
unless the nature and seriousness of the alleged offence calls for
communication outside the EU, for example if the report incriminates a
partner of another legal entity within the group, a high level member
or a management official of the company concerned. </li>
  <li>Transfers to third countries: usual restrictions apply</li>
  <li>the processing operations might be subject to prior
checking by the national data protection authority</li>

  <li>Limited
separation: Allow comingled corporate and personal data and/or

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId593425"></a>B.
Surveillance Activities </h2>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId857092"></a>1.
Surveillance by public authorities </h3>
<p>WP29 has issued an opinion stating "The European Essential
Guarantees": </p>
<ul>
  <li>Guarantee
A - Processing should be based on clear, precise and accessible rules.
[The] legal basis should in any case be set out in statute law
including the nature of the offences which may give rise to an
interception or surveillance order, a definition of the categories of
people that might be subject to surveillance, a limit on the duration
of the measure, the procedure to be followed for examining, using and
storing the data obtained, and the precautions to be taken when
communicating the data to other parties.</li>
  <li>Guarantee B
- Necessity and proportionality with regard to the legitimate
objectives pursued need to be demonstrated. The Courts do not seem to
have taken a final position on the legality of the massive and
indiscriminate collection of personal data (i.e. non-targeted bulk
collection) and their subsequent use, including the question under what
circumstances such collection and use of personal data could take
place. As regards the content of communications data, the CJEU is
clearer. It has stated in the Schrems judgment that public authorities
should not be allowed to have access to the content of electronic
communications on a generalised basis.However, the court does not
define what it understands ‘on a generalised basis’ to mean.</li>
  <li>Guarantee
C - An independent oversight mechanism should exist. Since the 1970s,
the ECtHR has held that any interference with the right to privacy and
data protection should be subject to an effective, independent and
impartial oversight system that must be provided for either by a judge
or by another independent body. Given the special nature of data
processing for intelligence purposes, it is accepted that the
processing takes place without the data subject being informed, in any
case at the start and during the surveillance operation.</li>
  <li>Guarantee
D - Effective remedies need to be available to the individual. For the
ECtHR, the question of an effective remedy is inextricably linked to
the notification of a surveillance measure to the individual once the
surveillance is over. </li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>Legal basis</p>
<p>Surveillance programmes run by the EU Member States will in
general not be subject to EU law, following the <span
 class="emphasis">national security exemption</span>
written into the European treaties, as well as – following this
decision of the contracting Member States – several EU regulations and
directives, including the EU data protection directive 95/46/EC. That
does not mean however such programmes are only subject to national law.
The analysis of the WP29 shows, that even though EU law in general and
the data protection directive in particular do not apply, the data
protection principles following the European Convention on Human Rights
and Council of Europe Convention 108 on the protection of personal data
will for the most part still need to be respected by the intelligence
services in order to lawfully perform their duties.</p>
<p>It
becomes clear from assessing the relevant national legislation that the
GDPL in many countries does not apply to the activities of intelligence
services and the data protection authority has a limited or in some
cases non-existent supervisory role.</p>
<p><span class="comment">They make a couple of
recommendations to improve the situation but basically this is out of
their jurisdiction.</span> </p>

</p>
<p>The
Snowden revelations and those emerging in parallel to the Snowden case
are not limited to US surveillance activities but also concern
surveillance by intelligence services of EU Member States, be it on
European territory or abroad. These are particularly relevant, since
several Europe-based intelligence services are now confirmed as having
a close working relationship with their US counterparts11. The closer
the relationship with the United States, the more information is shared
on the basis of reciprocity. This goes to show that national security
is less ‘national’ than the word would suggest: data, including
personal data, are shared and exchanged by intelligence services on a
large scale.</p>
<p>Any limitations to these fundamental rights
can only be accepted when they meet the conditions established by the
ECtHR and are thus restricted to specific, well described and
foreseeable situations. The Working Party therefore points out that if
compliance with the Council of Europe instruments is to be considered
effective, then no massive, indiscriminate and secret collection of
data relating to individuals subject to EU jurisdiction can be
tolerated by States party to the ECHR.</p>
<p>In summary, neither
the relevant provisions of EU law nor the CJEUs case law offer a clear
definition of what ‘national security’ is. Moreover, the EU and its
Member States use various rather similar notions related to security
without defining them: internal security, national security, State
security, public security and defense should all be distinguished, but
are in the view of the Working Party inextricably linked.</p>
<p>The
Snowden revelations and those emerging in parallel to the Snowden case

surveillance by intelligence services of EU Member States, be it on

the basis of reciprocity. This goes to show that national security is
less ‘national’ than the word would suggest: data, including personal
data, are shared and exchanged by intelligence services on a large
scale.</p>
<p>[...] the Working Party points out that the national
security exemption has to be interpreted to reflect the competence of
the EU vis-à-vis the Member States and not as a general exemption from
EU data protection requirements of all activities requested by third
countries in the name of national security. [...] Additionally, the
Working Party takes the view that it is important to critically assess
whether surveillance is actually conducted for the purpose of national
security.[...] The Working Party is concerned that EU (data protection)
law may be circumvented in practice with a mere reference to the data
processing being needed for national security purposes. </p>
<p><span class="comment">Basic
concern: although out of scope of Data protection directive (and GDPR),
many conventions still put restrictions on how and what a government
may do in terms of surveillance activities for the sake of national
security. They emphasise the obligation of member states to incorporate
restrictions in their national law guaranteeing surveillance is
necessary and proportional, offers suffiecient oversight and is
respecting freedom and rights of individuals. </span> </p>

the related traffic data by means of a public communications network
and publicly available electronic communications services, through
national legislation. In particular, they shall prohibit listening,
tapping, storage or other kinds of interception or surveillance of

Member States may adopt legislative measures to restrict the scope of
the rights and obligations provided for in Article 5, Article 6,
Article 8(1), (2), (3) and (4), and Article 9 of this Directive when
such restriction constitutes a necessary, appropriate and proportionate
measure within a democratic society to safeguard national security

templates and/or standard identity-kits resulting from certain outward
features (such as colour of a person’s skin, eyes, protruding
cheekbones,
etc.), or else on the basis of pre-defined abnormal behaviour (sudden
movements, repeated transit even at given intervals, way of parking a

apply if a camera is recording images of a public space such as a

Geolocation</h3>

</p>
<p>Privacy
risks: A smart mobile device is very intimately linked to a specific
individual. This allows the providers of geolocation based services to
gain an intimate overview of habits and patterns of the owner of such a
device and build extensive profiles. From a pattern of inactivity at
night, the sleeping place can be deduced, and from a regular travel
pattern in the morning, the location of an employer may be deduced. The
pattern may also include data derived from the movement patterns of
friends, based on the so-called social graph. 6 A behavioural pattern
may also include special categories of data, if it for example reveal
visits to hospitals and religious places, presence at political
demonstrations or presence at other specific locations revealing data
about for example sex life. These profiles can be used to take
decisions that significantly affect the owner. </p>
<p>Even when
people intentionally make their geolocation data available on the
Internet, through whereabout and geotagging services, the unlimited
global access creates new risks ranging from data theft to burglary, to
even physical aggression and stalking. As with other new technology, a
major risk with the use of location data is function creep, the fact
that based on the availability of a new type of data, new purposes are
being developed that were not anticipated at the time of the original
collection of the data. </p>
<p>Legal base depends on Location source:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Base
station data processed by telecom operators: The e-privacy directive
(2002/58/EC, as revised by 2009/136/EC) applies to the processing of
base station data by public electronic communication services and
networks (telecom operators). Since location data derived from base
stations relate to an identified or identifiable natural person, they
are subject to the provisions on the protection of personal data
(inform the data subject, consent). </li>
  <li>A combination
of base station, GPS and WiFi data: these are information society
services, as such they are explicitly excluded from the e-Privacy
directive. directive 95/46/EC [GDPR] applies. </li>
</ul>
<p>Personal
data: Smart mobile devices are inextricably linked to natural persons.
There is usually direct and indirect identifyability. The combination
of a MAC address of a WiFi access point with its calculated location,
should be treated as personal data.</p>
<p>3 types of controllers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Owners of databases with mapped WiFi access points are
controllers. </li>
  <li>The
provider of an application that is capable of processing geolocation
data is the controller for the processing of personal data resulting
from the installation and use of the application. </li>
  <li>The
developer of the operating system of the smart mobile device can be a
controller for the processing of geolocation data when it processes
personal data independently from the application provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>Legitimate ground:</p>
<p>Prior informed consent is also the main applicable ground for
making data processing legitimate when it comes to the <span
 class="emphasis">processing of the locations of a smart
mobile device</span> (more dificult in case of employees and
children). By default, location services must be switched off. </p>
<p>Given the semi-static nature of WiFi access points, the
mapping of <span class="emphasis">WiFi access points in
principle constitutes a lesser threat to the privacy</span>
of the owners of these access points than the real-time tracking of the
locations of smart mobile devices. In order for controllers to
successfully let their legitimate interests prevail over time over the
interests of the data subjects, they must develop and implement
guarantees, such as the right to easily and permanently opt-out from
the database, without needing to provide additional personal data to
the controller of such a database. Additionally, for the purpose of
offering geolocation services, the collection and processing of SSIDs
is not necessary. Therefore the <span class="emphasis">collection
and processing of SSIDs is excessive.</span> </p>
<p>Controllers
must respect data subjects rigthts such as a right to access possible
profiles based on these location data. If location information is
stored, users should be allowed to update, rectify or erase this
information. Also, retention may be no longer than is necessary for the
purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are
further processed. </p>

Online behavioural targeting </h3>
<p>Legal framework</p>
<p>Amended
Directive 2002/58 ("amended ePrivacy Directive") and Data Protection
Directive voth apply; the doctrine [that] states that a law governing a
specific subject matter (lex specialis) overrides a law which only
governs a general matter (lex generalis) In line with the above,
Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive which deals with informed
consent will be directly applicable. Directive 95/46 will be fully
applicable except for the provisions that are specifically addressed in
the ePrivacy Directive, which mainly correspond to Article 7 of
Directive 95/46/EC on the legal grounds for data processing</p>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<p>Roles and responsibilities <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ad
network providers are bound by the obligations of Article 5(3) of the
ePrivacy Directive insofar as they place cookies and/or retrieve
information from cookies already stored in the data subjects' terminal
equipment. They are also data controllers insofar as they determine the
purposes and the essential means of the processing of data. </li>
  <li>Publishers
have certain data controller related responsibilities regarding the
processing that takes place in the first phase of the processing, i.e.,
when by virtue of the way they set up their web sites they trigger the
transfer of the IP address to ad network providers (which enable the
further processing). Such responsibility entails some, limited data
protection obligations (see below). In addition, when/if publishers
transfer directly identifiable personal data to ad network providers
themselves, they will be deemed joint controllers. </li>
</ul>
<p>Obligations and rights <span class="comment">(some
stuff left out which is pretty self-evident)</span> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Article
5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive which sets up an obligation to obtain
prior informed consent applies to ad network providers. In practical
terms, they should ensure that individuals are told, at a minimum, who
(i.e. which entity) is responsible for serving the cookie and
collecting the related information. In addition, they should be
informed in simple ways that
    <ul>
      <li>(a) the cookie will be used to create profiles; </li>
      <li>(b) what type of information will be collected to build
such profiles; </li>
      <li>(c) the fact that the profiles will be used to deliver
targeted advertising and </li>
      <li>(d)
the fact that the cookie will enable the user's identification across
multiple web sites. Network providers/ publishers should provide the
information directly on the screen, interactively, if needed, through
layered notices. In any event it should be easily accessible and highly
visible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cookie-based opt-out
mechanisms in general do not constitute an adequate mechanism to obtain
informed user consent. In most cases user's consent is implied if they
do not opt out. However, in practice, very few people exercise the
opt-out option, not because they have made an informed decision to
accept behavioural advertising, but rather because they do not realise
that the processing is taking place, much less how to exercise the opt
out.</li>
  <li>In addition, the ad network providers should
enable individuals to exercise their rights of access and rectification
and erasure. </li>
  <li>Ad network providers should implement
retention policies which ensure that information collected each time
that a cookie is read is automatically deleted after a justified period
of time (necessary for the purposes of the processing). </li>
  <li>Providing
highly visible information is a precondition for consent to be valid.
Mentioning the practice of behavioural advertising in general terms and
conditions and/or privacy policies can never suffice.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>Opinion 16/2011 on EASA/IAB Best Practice Recommendation on
Online Behavioural Advertising</p>
<p>In
April 2011 the relevant actors engaged in online behavioural
advertising, represented by both the European Advertising Standards
Alliance (EASA) and the Internet Advertising Bureau Europe (IAB),
adopted a self-regulatory Best Practice Recommendation on online
behavioural advertising (hereinafter "EASA/IAB Code")</p>
<p>In
August 2011, the Article 29 WP sent an open letter to EASA and IAB
outlining the data protection concerns surrounding the opt-out approach
suggested within the EASA/IAB Code. In a subsequent meeting with the
Article 29 WP, representatives of EASA and IAB stated that “the Code
was primarily intended to create a level playing field" and that its
purpose was not to achieve compliance with the revised e-Privacy
Directive. </p>
<p>The proposed "information notice for
behavioural advertising icon" is not sufficient to provide the required
information because it is not widely recognized, not complete and
displayed after setting the cookie.Also, the icon provides an opt-out
choice instead of opt-in. </p>
<p>The first practical
implementation of the EASA/IAB Code is the www.youronlinechoices.eu
website, where the method selected to express “choice” is based on the
use of different "opt-out" cookies. The website contains a list with
different names of advertising networks. Users may indicate their
preference if they do not wish to receive targeted advertising from
one, more or all of the networks. Selecting one or more advertising
networks results in the installation of one or more opt-out cookies
from these networks. This implementation, apart from the fact that it
follows an opt-out approach and thus is not consistent with the
requirement for prior informed consent as set out in article 5(3) of
the revised e-Privacy Directive, has the following additional problems:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a) Although the opt-out cookie prevents the
further reception of personalised advertising, it does not stop the
advertising network from accessing and storing information in the
user's terminal. On the contrary, it has been demonstrated that an
ongoing technical exchange of information between the user’s terminal
equipment and the advertising network is still in place after the
installation of the opt-out cookie. </li>
  <li>b) The user is not informed on whether or not the tracking
cookie remains stored in his/her computer and for what purpose5 . </li>
  <li>c)
The installation of the opt-out cookie does not offer the possibility
to manage and delete previously installed tracking cookies, whereas at
the same time it creates the mistaken presumption that opting out
disables the tracking of internet behaviour. </li>
</ul>
<p>Adherence
to the EASA/IAB Code on online behavioural advertising and
participation in the website www.youronlinechoices.eu does not result
in compliance with the current e-Privacy Directive. Moreover, the Code
and the website create the wrong presumption that it is possible to
choose not be tracked while surfing the Web. This wrong presumption can
be damaging to users but also to the industry if they believe that by
applying the Code they meet the requirements of the Directive. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="NL">WP29 has
released opinion 196 about this: </span><span lang="NL"></span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data
protection risks of cloud computing: As this Opinion focuses on
personal data processing operations deploying cloud computing services,
only the specific risks related to this context are considered. The
majority of these risks fall within two broad categories namely lack of
control over the data, and insufficient information regarding the
processing operation itself (absence of transparency). </li>
  <li>The
cloud provider is the entity that provides the cloud computing services
in the various forms discussed above. When the cloud provider supplies
the means and the platform, acting on behalf of the cloud client, the
cloud provider is considered as a data processor</li>
  <li>Article
17(2) of Directive 95/46/EC puts full responsibility on cloud clients
(acting as data controllers) to choose cloud providers that implement
adequate technical and organisational security measures to protect
personal data and to be able to demonstrate accountability. </li>
  <li>In
addition to the core security objectives of availability,
confidentiality and integrity, attention must also be drawn to the
complementary data protection goals of transparency[…], isolation ,
intervenability, accountability and portability.</li>
  <li>Special
emphasis must be placed on the features of the applicable contracts –
these must include a set of standardised data protection safeguards
including those outlined by the WP in paragraph 3.4.3 (Technical and
Organisational Measures) and in paragraph 3.5 (cross-border data flows)
– as well as on additional mechanisms that can prove suitable for
facilitating due diligence and accountability (such as independent
third-party audits and certifications of a provider’s services – see
paragraph 4.2).</li>
  <li>To ensure legal certainty the
contract should also set forth the following issues: [a list of issues
that must be specified follows] </li>
  <li>Encryption of personal data should be used in all cases
when “in transit” and when available to data “at rest”.</li>

<p class="comment">Basically,
cloud providers are considered processers. Because the relationship
with a cloud provider is so much different than the classic concept of
a third party organization doing some some work on behalf of you, this
leads to many different problems. There is usually a big distance
between the business of the processor and the cloud provider; the cloud
provider may not even know what is being processed, how it is being
processed and for whom. Nor do they need to know to carry out their
work. But because even storage of data is considered processing, a
contract must exist with the cloud provider stating all the
requirements from article 28. That means </p>
<ul>
  <li class="comment">taking security measures tailored to
the customers data (article 32), </li>
  <li class="comment">right
to audit (impracticle where data may be on instances that are shared
with other companies or where data may change location on-the-fly), </li>
  <li class="comment">receiving
written instructions on how to process the data, where usually the
controller proceses the data itself on the cloud providers systems</li>

every cloud user if services are sub-contracted, like hosting on AWS</span>

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId479313"></a>Code
of conduct</h4>
<p class="comment">In
January 2015 a Code of conduct for cloud providers (CSPs) was submitted
for review to WP29. It was addressing several of the issues mentioned
in the IAPP comment. I could not locate the original version; a later
version from 2016 is available on <a
 href="http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=11194">http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=11194</a><span
 lang="NL"></span> </p>
<p class="comment"><span lang="NL">WP29 did
not approve the code yet. In an opinion they stated points for
improvement </span> </p>
<p class="comment"><span lang="NL">Main
issues:</span> </p>
<p class="comment"><span lang="NL">Some
issues were raised regarding the governance and enforcement and
transition to compliance. Some parts of the code were not specific
enough: </span> </p>
<ul>
  <li><span lang="NL">handling of cases involving
sensitive data, </span> </li>
  <li><span lang="NL">lack of information for the
customer on where data is located, </span> </li>
  <li><span lang="NL">lack of anonymisation and
pseudonimisation as a security measure, </span> </li>
  <li>missing
a clause that a processor shall communicate any legally binding request
for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority to
the controller unless otherwise prohibited <span lang="NL">
, </span>and
in any case, transfers of personal data by a processor to any public
authority cannot be massive, disproportionate and indiscriminate in a
manner that it would go beyond what is necessary in a democratic
society.</li>
  <li>The Code does not elaborate sufficiently on
the liability regime applicable to the parties in case of breach of
their data protection obligations. The Code must prevent the adoption
of terms of services that are to the disadvantage of the clients by
unduly limiting cloud providers’ obligations and liability and
restricting clients’ rights.</li>
  <li>WP29 recommends
expanding this section of the Code, with a specific care of the
handling of data subjects’ complaints/requests (5.8) and the need for
CSP to cooperate with customers to that effect.</li>
  <li>the
Code would benefit from the addition of a clause that would clearly
remind CSP that they should, depending on the context, either provide
adequate information to the data subject or cooperate in good faith
with their customer to enable him to properly inform data subjects.</li>
  <li>a reference to portability would contribute to the Code’s
sustainability</li>
  <li><span class="comment">The right to audit was
limiting the right as outlined by GDPR</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding security measures taken by the CSP:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To
this purpose, it is indeed fundamental that the CSP provides the
customer with “a sufficient level of detail on the security measures
implemented by the CSP”. This, though, should also be complemented by a
sufficient level of information on the threats on and vulnerabilities
of the CSP service and infrastructure and on the risk management
decisions taken by the CSP. If it is not the case, the background for
the customer to perform its own data protection risk management would
not be adequate.</li>
  <li>The Code imposes also on the CSP a
duty to perform a risk assessment “to ensure that the right of personal
data protection is guaranteed to the data subject”. The CSP should
consider establishing different levels of protection depending on the
“processing and the nature of the data to be protected” and to
advertise them publicly when offering their services. </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="comment">So
basically, the code does not yet sufficiently demand a risk management
process based on the specific type of data a CSP processes.</span>
</p>
<p>But:
WP29 is encouraged by the progress made by C-SIG in developing the Code
and supports the group in their efforts to finalise the Code by taking
into account comments made in this opinion and previous correspondence.
WP29 recognises the value that such a Code can provide to the cloud
computing industry and it does assist data controllers in assessing a
CSP and a particular cloud computing product or service. However, in
its current form there are still a number of significant gaps which
should be addressed before the Code is finalised. </p>

<p class="comment">I
had an extensive description here taken fro the two WP29 opinions, but
unfortunately it got lost a crash of my system. The short version:</p>
<p>Consent
has to be asked for setting a cookie unless it is stricly necessary to
deliver the service explicitly requested by the user. </p>
<p>Article
5.3 allows cookies to be exempted from the requirement of informed
consent, if they satisfy one of the following criteria: </p>
<ul>
  <li>CRITERION
A: the cookie is used “for the sole purpose of carrying out the
transmission of a communication over an electronic communications
network”. </li>
  <li>CRITERION B: the cookie is “strictly
necessary in order for the provider of an information society service
explicitly requested by the subscriber or user to provide the service” </li>
</ul>
<p>Two factors play an imprtant role in determining whether a
cookie setisfies these criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Whether it is a session or a persistent cookie</li>
  <li>Whether
it is a third party cookie. Third party here does not mean from a
diffeent domain, but if it is from a different processor</li>
</ul>
<p>Criterion
A may be satified by a session cookie that is used for load balancing
across multiple web servers, so that the user interacts with the same
server in order to preserve statefulness. The type of cookie has to fit
with the purpose of the cookie to fall under criterion A or B. Storing
language preferences in s session cookie is OK under criterion B if it
is a session cookie. Only if a user actively selects "remember me" is
it acceptable to store it in a persistent cookie.Additionally,
following the previous definitions, “third party” cookies are usually
not “strictly necessary” to the user visiting a website since these
cookies are usually related to a service that is distinct from the one
that has been “explicitly requested” by the user. </p>

<p>Conditions for consent:</p>
<p>Specific
information must be given about the purpose of the processing. It has
to be consented to before setting the cookie. It must be an active
choice. Assuming the user is OK with it by using the website is not OK.
Choice must be freely given. It is thus recommended to refrain from the
use of consent mechanisms that only provide an option for the user to
consent, but do not offer any choice regarding all or some cookies. If
certain cookies are therefore not needed in relation to the purpose of
provision of the website service, but only provide for additional
benefits of the website operator, the user should be given a real
choice regarding those cookies. Websites should not make conditional
“general access” to the site on acceptance of all cookies but can only
limit certain content if the user does not consent to cookies (e.g.:
for e-commerce websites, whose main purpose is to sell products, not
accepting (non-functional) cookies should not prevent a user from
buying products on this website).</p>
<p>Users should also be
offered a real choice regarding tracking cookies. Such tracking cookies
are generally used to follow individual behaviour across websites,
create profiles based on that behaviour, infer interests, and take
decisions affecting people individually. When tracking cookies are
being used to single out people in this way, they are likely to be
personal data. For the processing of the personal data that goes
together with the reading and setting of tracking cookies the data
controller needs to obtain the unambiguous consent of the user. </p>

Search engine marketing (SEM) </h3>
<p><span class="comment">This seems to concern
advertising networks and tracking cookies.</span> </p>
<p>From a user’s point of view, major privacy and security
concerns are as follows: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Certain
advertisements contain external applications, which can often affect
users’ browser settings, or show pop-ups in non-affiliated pages. Such
applications might also be spyware.</li>
  <li>Third-party
cookies can seriously compromise the user’s privacy or anonymity. Such
cookies can enable advertisers to trace the address of the browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>In
June 2010, a controversy arose around new additions to Google Analytics
and the privacy issues that it touched upon. With these new additions,
it became possible for website operations to use the search engine
optimization suite to sift through Facebook profiles and Twitter posts.
The software allowed individuals to conduct search engine marketing
campaigns to find Facebook and Twitter profiles of individuals who have
visited their websites, including a certain amount of personal
information about these individuals.</p>

</p>
<p>Opinion regarding data protection issues related to search
engines:</p>
<p> two different roles are played by search engine providers
with regard to personal data: </p>
<ul>
  <li>First,
in their role as service providers to the users, search engines collect
and process vast amounts of user data, including data gathered by
technical means, such as cookies. Data collected can range from the IP
address of individual users to extensive histories of past searching
behaviour or data provided by users themselves when signing up to use
personalised services. The profitability of such search engines
generally relies on the effectiveness of the advertising that
accompanies the search results. They process IP addresses, log files
containing searh queries, cookies.</li>
  <li>Second, in their
role as content providers, search engines help to make publications on
the internet easily accessible to a worldwide audience. By retrieving
and grouping widespread information of various types about a single
person, search engines can create a new picture, with a much higher
risk to the data subject than if each item of data posted on the
internet remained separate. [...] The Data Protection Directive does
not contain a special reference to the processing of personal data by
information society services that act as selection intermediaries. The
principle of proportionality requires that to the extent that a search
engine provider acts purely as an intermediary, it should not be
considered to be the principal controller with regard to the content
related processing of personal data that is taking place. In this case
the principal controllers of personal data are the information
providers. Website owners may opt out a priori of both the search
engine and the caching by using the robots.txt file or the
Noindex/NoArchive tag. Some search engines republish data in a
so-called ‘cache’. Any caching period of personal data contained in
indexed websites beyond this necessity of technical availability,
should be considered an independent republication. The right to correct
or delete information also applies to some specific cache data held by
search engine providers, </li>
</ul>
<p>But also more
sophisticated technology exists and is increasingly being employed by
search engine providers, such as facial recognition technology in the
context of image processing and image search. Thus search engine
providers may perform value-added operations linked to characteristics
or types of personal data on the information they process.</p>
<p>The
Working Party finds that the correlation of personal data across
services and platforms for authenticated users can only be legitimately
done based on consent, after the users have been adequately informed.
Correlation can also be done for non-authenticated users, based on IP
address or on a unique cookie that can be recognised by all the
different services offered by a search engine provider. Usually this is
done in an automatic way, without the user being aware of such a
correlation. Covert surveillance of people's behaviour, certainly
private behaviour such as visiting websites, is not in accordance with
the principles of fair and legitimate processing of the Data Protection
Directive. Search engine providers should be very clear about the
extent of correlation of data across services and only proceed on the
basis of consent. </p>
<p>Obligations on search engine providers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Search
engines may only process personal data for legitimate purposes and the
amount of data has to be relevant and not excessive in respect of the
various purposes to be achieved. </li>
  <li>Search engine
providers must delete or anonymise (in an irreversible and efficient
way) personal data once they are no longer necessary for the purpose
for which they were collected. The Working Party calls for the
development of appropriate anonymisation schemes by search engine
providers. </li>
  <li>Retention periods should be minimised
and be proportionate to each purpose put forward by search engine
providers. In view of the initial explanations given by search engine
providers on the possible purposes for collecting personal data, the
Working Party does not see a basis for a retention period beyond 6
months. However, national legislation may require earlier deletion of
personal data. In case search engine providers retain personal data
longer than 6 months, they must demonstrate comprehensively that it is
strictly necessary for the service. In any case, the information about
the data retention period chosen by search engine providers should be
easily accessible from their homepage. <br>
  </li>
  <li>While search engine providers
inevitably collect some personal data about the users of their
services, such as their IP address, resulting from standard HTTP
traffic, it is not necessary to collect additional personal data from
individual users in order to be able to perform the service of
delivering search results and advertisements. <br>
  </li>
  <li>If search engine providers use
cookies, their lifetime should be no longer than demonstrably
necessary. Similarly to web cookies, flash cookies should only be
installed if transparent information is provided about the purpose for
which they are installed and how to access, edit and delete this
information. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Search engine providers must give
users clear and intelligible information about their identity and
location and about the data they intend to collect, store or transmit,
as well as the purpose for which they are collected2 <br>
  </li>
  <li>Enrichment of user profiles with data not provided by the
users themselves is to be based on the consent of the users. <br>
  </li>
  <li>If
search engine providers provide means to retain the individual search
history, they should make sure they have the consent of the user. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Search engines should respect
website editor opt-outs indicating that the website should not be
crawled and indexed or included in the search engines’ caches. <br>
  </li>
  <li>When search engine providers
provide a cache, in which personal data are being made available for
longer than the original publication, they must respect the right of
data subjects to have excessive and inaccurate data removed from their
cache. </li>
  <li>Search engine providers that specialise in
the creation of value added operations, such as profiles of natural
persons (so called ‘people search engines’) and facial recognition
software on images must have a legitimate ground for processing, such
as consent, and meet all other requirements of the Data Protection
Directive, such as the obligation to guarantee the quality of data and
fairness of processing. </li>
</ul>

Social networking services </h3>
<p>Personal data published on social network sites can be used by
third parties for a
wide variety of purposes, including commercial purposes, and may pose
major risks such as
identity theft, financial loss, loss of business or employment
opportunities and physical harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SNS providers are data controllers under the Data Protection
Directive. They provide the
means for the processing of user data and provide all the “basic”
services related to user
management (e.g. registration and deletion of accounts). SNS providers
also determine the
use that may be made of user data for advertising and marketing
purposes - including
advertising provided by third parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Application providers:
Application providers may also be data controllers, if they develop
applications which run in
addition to the ones from the SNS and users decide to use such an
application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users:
In most cases, users are considered to be data subjects. The Directive
does not impose the
duties of a data controller on an individual who processes personal
data "in the course of a
purely personal or household activity" - the so-called "household
exemption".&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some
instances, the activities of a user of an SNS may not be covered by the
household exemption
and the user might be considered to have taken on some of the
responsibilities of a data
controller:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If an SNS user acts on behalf of a company or association,
or uses
the SNS mainly as a platform to advance commercial, political or
charitable goals, the
[household] exception does not apply.</li>
  <li>When access to profile information extends beyond
self-selected contacts, such as when
access to a profile is provided to all members within the SNS8 or the
data is indexable by
search engines, access goes beyond the personal or household sphere.
Equally, if a user takes
an informed decision to extend access beyond self-selected ‘friends’
data controller
responsibilities come into force.&nbsp;It should be kept in mind
that, even if the household exemption does not apply, the SNS user
may benefit from other exemptions such as the exemption for
journalistic purposes, artistic or
literary expression. In those cases, a balance needs to be struck
between freedom of
expression and the right to privacy. </li>
  <li>The application of the household exemption is also
constrained by the need to guarantee the
rights of third parties, particularly with regard to sensitive data. In
addition, it must be noted
that even if the household exemption applies, a user might be liable
according to general
provisions of national civil or criminal laws in question (e.g.
defamation, liability in tort for
violation of personality, penal liability).</li>
</ul>
<p>SNS should offer privacy-friendly default settings which allow
users to freely and
specifically consent to any access to their profile's content that is
beyond their self-selected
contacts in order to reduce the risk of unlawful processing by third
parties. Restricted access
profiles should not be discoverable by internal search engines,
including the facility to search
by parameters such as age or location. Decisions to extend access may
not be implicit, for
example with an "opt-out" provided by the controller of the SNS.</p>
<p>Data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
religious or philosophical beliefs,
trade-union membership or data concerning health or sex life is
considered sensitive.
Sensitive personal data may only be published on the Internet with the
explicit consent from
the data subject or if the data subject has made the data manifestly
public himself.&nbsp;In some EU Member States, images of data
subjects are considered a special category of
personal data since they may be used to distinguish between
racial/ethnic origins or may be
used to deduce religious beliefs or health data. The Working Party in
general does not
consider images on the Internet to be sensitive data, unless the images
are clearly used to
reveal sensitive data about individuals.</p>
<p>The creation of pre-built profiles of non-members through the
aggregation of data
that is independently contributed by SNS users, including relationship
data inferred from
uploaded address books, lacks a legal basis.</p>
<p>SNS-mediated access:
In addition to the core SNS service, most SNS offer users additional
applications provided by
third party developers which also process personal data.
SNS should have the means to ensure that third party applications
comply with the Data
Protection and ePrivacy Directives. </p>
<p>User-mediated third party access: When
offering an API that enables access to contacts' data, SNS should
provide for a level of granularity that lets the user choose an access
level for the third
party that is only just sufficient to perform a certain task.. When
accessing personal data via third party’s API on behalf of a user,
third party services
should:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>process and store data no longer than necessary to perform
a specific task;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>perform no operations on imported user contacts' data other
than personal usage by the
contributing user.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some SNS allow their users to send invitations to third
parties. The prohibition on the use of
electronic mail for the purposes of direct marketing does not apply to
personal
communications <span style="font-style: italic;">(certain
restrictions apply)</span>.</p>
<p>When a user does not use the service for a defined period of
time, the profile should be set to
inactive, i.e. no longer visible to other users or the outside world,
and after another period of
time the data in the abandoned account should be deleted. SNS should
notify users before
taking these steps with whatever means they have at their disposal. </p>
<p> [...] it can be observed that SNS may need to register some
identifying data about members but does not need to publish the real
name of members on the
Internet. Therefore, SNS should consider carefully if they can justify
forcing their users to act
under their real identity rather than under a pseudonym. There are
strong arguments in favor
of giving users choice in this respect and in at least one Member
State, this is a legal
requirement. The arguments are particularly strong in the case of SNS
with wide membership.&nbsp;Users should, in general, be allowed to
adopt a pseudonym. </p>
